We examined allele loss at three known tumour suppressor gene regions (22q/NF2 gene, 9p/p16 gene, and 3p/FHIT gene) and at two other frequently deleted areas (14q and 6q) in MM. […] To study if LOH of the NF2 gene is a consistent feature in MM, we performed a more detailed analysis of chromosome 22q that included a NF2 marker (NF2CA3). […] In particular, 100% of the cultured MM cells exhibited LOH at the NF2 gene region. […] In conclusion, our present LOH data indicate that MM cells exhibit allele losses at multiple tumour suppressor gene sites concurrently, involving NF2 gene preferentially.

Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is caused by inactivating mutations of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. […] Somatic NF2 mutations also occur in a high proportion of human primary malignant mesotheliomas.

Human malignant mesotheliomas frequently show hypermethylation or deletions at the Cdkn2a/Arf and Cdkn2b gene loci and deletions or mutations at the NF2 gene locus. […] Heterozygous Nf2 (+/-) mice exposed to crocidolite asbestos fibers exhibited accelerated development of malignant mesotheliomas compared to wild-type littermates. […] Loss of the wild-type Nf2 allele, leading to biallelic inactivation, was observed in nine mesothelioma cell lines derived from Nf2 (+/-) mice. […] Similar to human malignant mesotheliomas, tumors from Nf2 (+/-) mice showed frequent homozygous deletions of the Cdkn2a/Arf locus and adjacent Cdkn2b tumor suppressor gene.

In a previous study, mesotheliomas were found in hemizygous Nf2 (Nf2(+/-)) mice exposed to asbestos fibres, and showed similar alterations in genes at the Ink4 locus and in Trp53 as described in HMM. […] Here we found that Nf2(+/-) mice developed mesotheliomas after intra-peritoneal inoculation of a RCF sample (RCF1). […] Early passages of 12 mesothelioma cell cultures from ascites developed in RCF1-exposed Nf2(+/-) mice demonstrated frequent inactivation by deletion of genes at the Ink4 locus, and low rate of Trp53 point and insertion mutations. […] Nf2 gene was inactivated in all cultures. […] In most cases, co-inactivation of genes at the Ink4 locus and Nf2 was found and, at a lower rate, of Trp53 and Nf2. […] They suggest that nf2 mutation is complementary of p15(Ink4b), p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) or p53 mutations and show similar profile of gene alterations resulting from exposure to ceramic or asbestos fibres in Nf2(+/-) mice, also consistent with the one found in HMM.

We analyzed the involvement of YAP1 in MPM proliferation, as well as its functional and physical interaction with Merlin encoded by the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor gene, which is frequently mutated in MPMs. […] YAP1-RNA interference suppressed growth of a mesothelioma cell line NCI-H290 with NF2 homozygous deletion, probably through cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, whereas YAP1 transfection promoted the growth of MeT-5A, an immortalized mesothelial cell line. […] We also found that the introduction of NF2 into NCI-H290 induced phosphorylation at serine 127 of YAP1, which was accompanied by reduction of nuclear localization of YAP1, whereas nuclear localization of a YAP1 S 127A mutant was not affected.

A molecular analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were located in the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) gene, a tumor suppressor gene assigned to chromosome 22q12.3, revealed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the NF2 gene. […] Furthermore, SNP analyses determined that LOH was observed in the IL17RA (22q11.1), CHECK2 (22q12.1), and SHANK3 (22q13.3) genes, thus suggesting that NF2 loss occurred through 22q deletions or monosomy 22.

Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive, asbestos-related cancer frequently marked by mutations of both NF2 and CDKN2A.

[…] Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. […] Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). […] Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. […] Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. […] Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met. […] These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.

[…] A combination of NF2 FISH, 9p21 FISH, and BAP1 immunohistochemistry yielded greater sensitivity (100%) than that detected for either diagnostic assay alone (53.2% for NF2 FISH, 78.7% for 9p21 FISH, 70.2% for MTAP immunohistochemistry, or 57.4% for BAP1 immunohistochemistry). […] Thus, NF2 FISH in combination with other diagnostic assays is effective for distinguishing malignant pleural mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.

Genomic characterization identified several subgroups: (1) BAP1 mutations with deletions of CDKN2A and NF2 in two tumors; (2) TRAF7 mutations in two tumors, including one harboring trisomies of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, and X; and (3) genomic near-haploidization, characterized by extensive loss of heterozygosity sparing chromosomes 5 and 7.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), an inherited disorder associated with multiple inherited schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas is caused by an autosomal dominant, likely loss of function germline mutation of the NF2 gene. […] Interestingly, biallelic NF2 gene inactivation is one of the most common mutations associated with the development of malignant mesothelioma (MM), a highly fatal malignancy that arises in the pleura and less frequently in the pericardium, peritoneum, and tunica vaginalis. […] It has been proposed that NF2 patients could potentially be at increased risk of developing MM. […] However, patients with inherited NF2 rarely develop MM. […] In our patient diagnosed with NF2 at age 25 who developed an aggressive peritoneal MM 15 years later, we identified a germline NF2 mutation and somatic mutations including BAP1. […] Of clinical relevance, our case supports a germline NF2 mutation may not necessarily be more susceptible to develop mesothelioma without a “second hit” mutation.

Mutations in TERT promoter, NF2, and LATS2 were more frequent in nonepithelioid MPM and positively associated with the S.score. […] BAP1, NF2, TERT promoter, TP53, and SETD2 mutations were enriched in some molecular subtypes. […] NF2 mutation rate was higher in asbestos unexposed patient. […] TERT promoter, NF2, and TP53 mutations were associated with a poorer overall survival.

The neurofibromatosis type 2 gene (NF2) is a tumor suppressor gene assigned to chromosome 22q which plays an important role in the development of familial and spontaneous tumors of neuroectodermal origin. […] Although MMs have a different histogenic derivation, the frequent abnormalities of chromosome 22 warranted an investigation of the NF2 gene in these tumors. […] Both cDNAs from 15 MM cell lines and genomic DNAs from 7 matched primary tumors were analyzed for mutations within the NF2 coding region. […] NF2 mutations predicting either interstitial in-frame deletions or truncation of the NF2-encoded protein (merlin) were detected in eight cell lines (53%), six of which were confirmed in primary tumor DNAs. […] In two samples that showed NF2 gene transcript alterations, no genomic DNA mutations were detected, suggesting that aberrant splicing may constitute an additional mechanism for merlin inactivation. […] These findings implicate NF2 in the oncogenesis of primary MMs and provide evidence that this gene can be involved in the development of tumors other than nervous system neoplasms characteristic of the NF2 disorder. […] In addition, unlike NF2-related tumors, MM derives from the mesoderm; malignancies of this origin have not previously been associated with frequent alterations of the NF2 gene.
