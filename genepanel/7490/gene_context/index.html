Syndecan-1 binds basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), modulates neovascularization, plays a role in epithelial differentiation and is up-regulated by WT1. […] This study has analysed syndecan-1 expression in mesothelioma tumours and cell lines by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, using anti-syndecan-1 antibody directed against the core protein, and has examined its relation to morphology, bFGF, WT1, and intra-tumoural microvascular density (IMD). […] These studies indicate that (1) there is no correlation of syndecan-1 with either bFGF expression or IMD in mesotheliomas in vivo; (2) syndecan-1 is strongly expressed in the epithelial type of mesothelioma and in the epithelial component of biphasic mesotheliomas and the expression is reduced or lost in sarcomatoid differentiation; together with the finding that (3) syndecan-1 correlates with WT1 immuno-expression, this suggests that syndecan-1 might relate to the differentiation state of mesothelial/mesothelioma cells; and (4) syndecan-1-positive tumours are associated with a longer survival (p = 0.02) than mesotheliomas with no or little syndecan-1 expression, on univariate analysis.

The Wilms’ tumour susceptibility gene 1 (WT1) is expressed during transitions of mesenchyme to epithelial tissues, as in the embryonic kidney, and it has been suggested as a marker for the mesothelial lineage. […] To investigate how the epithelial and fibroblast-like differentiation of benign mesothelial cells was correlated to WT1, PGs and hyaluronan synthase, we studied their expression by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses. […] Cell lines with epithelial morphology expressed more mRNA coding for WT1 and cell surface PGs than did the fibroblastic ones, the difference being greatest for syndecan-4 and glypican. […] The increase in WT1-associated mRNA was about as great as that of syndecans. […] The results indicate that the regulation of mesothelial differentiation is multifactorial and also involves WT1 and several PGs.

It has been shown that detection of the Wilms tumor susceptibility gene 1 protein (WT1) has diagnostic utility in the distinction of mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma in tissue sections of pleural tumors. […] This immunohistochemical study evaluates the effectiveness of WT1 as a marker for malignant mesothelioma in paraffin sections of cell block preparations derived from effusion specimens. […] The authors evaluated 111 cell blocks for WT1 immunoreactivity, including 14 mesotheliomas and 97 metastatic adenocarcinomas from various sites. […] Nuclear reactivity for WT1 was observed in all samples of mesothelioma. […] However, only 22 of 97 samples (23%) of metastatic adenocarcinoma, nearly all of which were of ovarian origin (91%), exhibited nuclear reactivity for WT1. […] In 14 other samples (most of pulmonary derivation), WT1 staining restricted to the cytoplasm was observed for some tumor cells and was regarded as nonspecific. […] Based on this staining profile, WT1 represents an effective marker for mesotheliomas in cell block preparations and can aid in its distinction from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. […] In assessment of effusion specimens with metastatic carcinoma, nuclear reactivity for WT1 is highly suggestive of an ovary primary tumor

Sixty epithelioid mesotheliomas and 50 lung adenocarcinomas were investigated for expression of the following markers: calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, WT1, thrombomodulin, mesothelin, CD44S, HBME-1, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, MOC-31, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), BG-8 (Lewisy), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Ber-EP4, B72.3 (TAG-72), leu-M1 (CD15), CA19-9, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and vimentin. […] All (100%) of the mesotheliomas reacted for calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, and mesothelin, 93% for WT1, 93% for EMA, 85% for HBME-1, 77% for thrombomodulin; 73% for CD44S, 73% for N-cadherin, 55% for vimentin, 40% for E-cadherin, 18% for Ber-EP4, 8% for MOC-31, 7% for BG-8, and none for CEA, B72.3, leu-M1, TTF-1, or CA19-9. […] Of the adenocarcinomas, 100% were positive for MOC-31, Ber-EP4, and EMA, 96% for BG-8, 88% for CEA, 88% for E-cadherin, 84% for B72.3, 74% for TTF-1, 72% for leu-M1, 68% for HBME-1, 48% for CD44S, 48% for CA19-9, 38% for mesothelin, 38% for vimentin, 30% for N-cadherin, 14% for thrombomodulin, 8% for calretinin, 2% for cytokeratin 5/6, and none for WT1. […] After analyzing the results, it is concluded that calretinin, cytokeratin 5/6, and WT1 are the best positive markers for differentiating epithelioid malignant mesothelioma from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. […] Because of their specificity and sensitivity for mesotheliomas, the best combination appears to be calretinin and cytokeratin 5/6 (or WT1) for the positive markers and CEA and MOC-31 (or B72.3, Ber-EP4, or BG-8) for the negative markers.

The transcription factor, WT1, is highly overexpressed in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and immunohistochemical stains for WT1 are used routinely to aid in its diagnosis. […] Using computer prediction analysis we designed analog peptides derived from WT1 sequences by substituting amino acids at key HLA-A0201 binding positions. […] We tested the safety and immunogenicity of a WT1 vaccine comprised of four class I and class II peptides in patients with thoracic neoplasms expressing WT1. […] Immune responses were evaluated by DTH, CD4 T-cell proliferation, CD8 T-cell interferon gamma release, intracellular cytokine staining, WT1 peptide MHC-tetramer staining, and cytotoxicity against WT1 positive tumor cells. […] Six out of nine patients tested demonstrated CD4 T-cell proliferation to WT1 specific peptides, and five of the six HLA-A0201 patients tested mounted a CD8 T-cell response. […] This multivalent WT1 peptide analog vaccine induces immune responses in a high proportion of patients with thoracic malignancies with minimal toxicity.

Calretinin and Wilms’ tumor gene (WT1) are mesothelial markers routinely used to confirm the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

Although nuclear Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) expression is widely used to detect tumors of ovarian and mesothelial origin, it is less well known that WT1 is also expressed in the cytoplasm of melanomas and mesenchymal tumors. […] Because to the authors’ knowledge the diagnostic utility of cytoplasmic WT1 expression has not been explored to date, the usefulness of a WT1/AE1/AE3 dual-color immunostain in the workup of malignant effusions was evaluated. […] A total of 86 pleural effusions, including 17 metastatic melanomas, 31 metastatic adenocarcinomas, 10 malignant mesotheliomas, 10 lymphoproliferative disorders, 5 metastatic sarcomas, and 13 benign specimens, were immunostained using a peroxidase-based brown chromogen for WT1 and an alkaline phosphatase-based red chromogen for AE1/AE3 on cell block sections. […] The majority of malignant effusions stained in 1 of 4 distinctive patterns: 1) all lung and breast adenocarcinomas demonstrated cytoplasmic AE1/AE3 expression without nuclear or cytoplasmic WT1 expression; 2) serous carcinomas of Müllerian origin, mesotheliomas, and benign mesothelial cells were positive for cytoplasmic AE1/AE3 as well as nuclear WT1; 3) melanomas, sarcomas, and a subset of plasma cell neoplasms were positive for cytoplasmic expression of WT1 but negative for AE1/AE3; and 4) large B-cell lymphomas and a subset of plasma cell neoplasms were negative for both markers. […] A WT1/AE1/AE3 dual-color immunostain can reliably identify malignancy in pleural effusions and group malignant cells into discrete subsets, thereby narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Because of evidence suggesting that the Wilms’ tumor susceptibility gene (WT1), unlike other tumor suppressor genes, is restricted mostly to mesenchymally derived tissues, we hypothesized that the WT1 gene products could serve as a potential marker for mesothelioma. […] The expression of WT1 mRNA was analyzed in 19 malignant mesothelioma cell lines and 9 tumors and compared with the expression of WT1 in 10 non-small cell lung cancer lines and 9 lung cancer specimens. […] WT1 mRNA was detectable by Northern analysis in 16 of 19 mesothelioma cell lines and in 5 of 8 malignant mesothelioma tumors. […] In contrast, WT1 mRNA was not detected by Northern analysis in non-small cell lung cancer lines or carcinomas. […] Immunoprecipitation with an anti-WT1 monoclonal antibody showed that a 52- to 54-kd protein was present in 4 mesothelioma cell lines. […] Immunostaining with this antibody localized the WT1 protein to the nucleus in two mesothelioma lines and in 20 of 21 mesothelioma tumors examined. […] The detection of WT1 mRNA or protein may thus provide a specific molecular or immunohistochemical marker for differentiation of mesothelioma from other pleural tumors, in particular, adenocarcinoma.

[…] This study assessed WT1 gene status by mutational screening in 42 malignant mesotheliomas (MMs) and 3 MM cell lines and detected two tumours with identical heterozygous single nucleotide deletions in intron 7, with no apparent consequence for WT1 function. […] Furthermore, the expression pattern of the WT1 gene was studied in MMs and related lesions using three anti-WT1 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). […] WT1 immunoreactivity was absent in all primary tumours of lung and in pleural metastases from adenocarcinomas of breast and colon; immunoreactivity was present in pleural metastases from renal carcinomas, melanomas, and papillary carcinomas of the ovary. […] Expression of the WT1 protein in MM was not correlated with survival. […] Coordinate expression of the WT1 protein and its putative transcriptional target genes was determined by correlating WT1 immunostaining with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression on MM and NNM; no significant correlation was found, irrespective of p53 expression status. […] Finally, the putative involvement of WT1 in cell-type transition was supported by this study, in that epithelial mesothelioma showed the strongest WT1 immunoreactivity while sarcomatous mesothelioma showed the least.
