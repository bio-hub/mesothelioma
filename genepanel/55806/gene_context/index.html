We present the results of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), a secondary endpoint of MAPS. […] HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 and the lung cancer-specific module QLQ-LC13 at randomization and then every 9 weeks until disease progression.HRQoL deterioration-free survival (QFS), used to analyze longitudinal HRQoL data, was defined as the interval between randomization and the occurrence of the first clinically relevant definitive deterioration compared with the HRQoL score at baseline, or death. […] At baseline, 425 patients (94.8%) completed the HRQoL questionnaire. […] We report that adding bevacizumab to cisplatin and pemetrexed (PCB) significantly improved QFS for the peripheral neuropathy dimension, with a median QFS of 12.09 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.59-13.67] in the PCB arm versus 7.59 months (95% CI, 6.57-8.61) in the PC arm [HR (PCB vs. […] QFS was also longer in the PCB arm for the pain dimension (HR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69-1.02; <i>P</i> = 0.08). […] This study demonstrated that adding bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced MPM had no negative impact on HRQoL. […] A significant improvement in the peripheral neuropathy and pain HRQoL dimensions was even observed.

CCDC6 (coiled-coil domain containing 6) is a player of the HR response to DNA damage and has been predicted to interact with BAP1, another HR-DNA repair gene highly mutated in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. […] Upon USP7 inhibition, that induces CCDC6 degradation, the ability to repair the DSBs and the sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, was explored by HR reporter and by cells viability assays, respectively. […] The silencing of CCDC6 when combined with the overexpression of BAP1-mutant (Δ221-238) enhanced the HR-DNA repair defects and the PARP inhibitors sensitivity.

Under physiological conditions, the tightly regulated interaction between CD70 and CD27 plays a co-stimulatory role in promoting T-cell expansion and differentiation through the NFκB pathway. […] As potential independent risk factors for MPM patients, multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed CD70 expression on mesothelioma cells [hazard ratio (HR) 2.25; p = 0.010], higher FOXP3<sup>+</sup> TILs (HR 2.81; p = 0.004), and higher CD3<sup>+</sup> TIL accumulation (HR 6.12; p &lt; 0.001).

One of the major side effects of cisplatin is dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. […] We recently demonstrated that the renal uptake of cisplatin and resultant cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity are mediated in part by megalin, an endocytic receptor in proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). […] The present study examined the correlation of urinary megalin level with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and its utility as a biomarker in patients with thoracic cancer. […] In addition, according to the hazard ratios (HRs) for eGFR decline &gt; 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model, the highest quartile had a significantly higher risk of eGFR decline compared with the lowest quartile (HR 7.243; 95% confidence interval 1.545-33.962). […] This is the first report demonstrating that prechemotherapy urinary A-megalin levels are correlated with the development of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. […] This finding has clinical implications for the identification of patients at risk for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and the development of possible prophylactic therapies.
