Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. […] Homozygous deletion appears to be the major mechanism affecting p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF, whereas inactivating mutations coupled with allelic loss occur at the NF2 locus. […] The frequent occurrence of homozygous deletions of p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF and the ability of SV40 Tag to bind TSG products suggest that perturbations of both Rb- and p53-dependent growth-regulatory pathways are critically involved in the pathogenesis of MM.

Homozygous deletion of CDKN2A is frequent in mesothelioma (present in &gt; 70% of tumors). […] Therefore, detection of CDKN2A deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was evaluated as an ancillary test in the cytologic diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. […] Dual-color FISH for CDKN2A and chromosome 9 centromere was performed on cytolyt-fixed Thinprep slides from 6 cytologically suspicious and 7 cytologically positive effusions (all with histologically confirmed mesothelioma) and in 19 cytologically benign effusions (14 pleural effusions, 3 pericardial effusions, and 2 abdominal fluid specimens). […] Specimens containing &gt; or = 15 nuclei that lacked signals for CDKN2A but showed at least 1 signal for chromosome 9 centromere were considered positive. […] In samples with negative cytology, the nuclei of at least 100 mesothelial cells were evaluated; whereas, in specimens with positive or suspicious cytology, counting nuclei was done only if &lt; 15% of nuclei showed homozygous loss of CDKN2A. […] All 19 cytologically negative specimens were negative for CDKN2A deletion. […] The detection of homozygous CDKN2A deletion by FISH would have been helpful in confirming a diagnosis of mesothelioma over reactive mesothelial cells in 12 of 13 samples with positive or suspicious cytology.

Homozygous deletion of P16/CDKN2A is found in approximately 75% of mesotheliomas amd may be the most common genetic alteration in this cancer. […] In terms of prognosis, P16/CDKN2A loss is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior in mesotheliomas. […] The homozygous co-deletion of MTAP, encoding the enzyme methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, in approximately 90% of mesotheliomas with P16/CDKN2A loss has potential therapeutic applications because MTAP-deficient tumors may be responsive to inhibitors of de novo AMP synthesis. […] Finally, global gene expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A chips finds few gene expression correlates of P16/CDKN2A deletion in pleural mesothelioma, consistent with its non-transcriptional mode of direct action through regulation of cell cycle-related kinase signaling.

To develop a fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) assay for detecting p16/CDKN2A deletion on paraffin tissue sections for use as an ancillary test to distinguish reactive from malignant mesothelial proliferations. […] Dual-colour FISH for p16/CDKN2A and chromosome 9 (CEP-9) was performed on 11 benign mesothelial proliferations and 54 malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cases to establish cut-off values for p16/CDKN2A deletion. […] Cut-off values for p16/CDKN2A deletion were calculated based on FISH signalling patterns obtained from the benign controls (mean percent nuclei plus three standard deviations). […] Hemizygous deletion was defined as &gt;44% of nuclei showing the hemizygous (one p16/CDKN2A, two CEP-9 signals) or &gt;15% of nuclei showing the monosomy (one p16/CDKN2A, one CEP-9 signal) deletion patterns. […] None of the benign cases showed a homozygous deletion pattern (no p16/CDKN2A, at least one CEP-9 signal). […] P16/CDKN2A deletion was detected in 61% (33/54) of MPM cases. […] Among the equivocal biopsies, four showed homozygous and one showed hemizygous p16/CDKN2A deletion. […] Age over 60 years, asbestos exposure and p16/CDKN2A deletion were associated with a worse prognosis. […] FISH for p16/CDKN2A deletion is a useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MPM.

Malignant mesothelioma is a highly aggressive, asbestos-related cancer frequently marked by mutations of both NF2 and CDKN2A. […] Ascites from some Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice exhibited large tumor spheroids, and tail vein injections of malignant mesothelioma cells established from these mice, but not from Nf2(+/-) or wild-type mice, produced numerous tumors in the lung, suggesting increased metastatic potential of tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice. […] Intraperitoneal injections of malignant mesothelioma cells derived from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice into severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors that penetrated the diaphragm and pleural cavity and harbored increased cancer stem cells (CSC). […] Malignant mesothelioma cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice stained positively for CSC markers and formed CSC spheroids in vitro more efficiently than counterparts from wild-type mice. […] Moreover, tumor cells from Nf2(+/-);Cdkn2a(+/-) mice showed elevated c-Met expression/activation, which was partly dependent on p53-mediated regulation of miR-34a and required for tumor migration/invasiveness and maintenance of the CSC population. […] Collectively, these studies demonstrate in vivo that inactivation of Nf2 and Cdkn2a cooperate to drive the development of highly aggressive malignant mesotheliomas characterized by enhanced tumor spreading capability and the presence of a CSC population associated with p53/miR-34a-dependent activation of c-Met. […] These findings suggest that cooperativity between losses of Nf2 and Cdkn2a plays a fundamental role in driving the highly aggressive tumorigenic phenotype considered to be a hallmark of malignant mesothelioma.

The molecular pathogenesis of peritoneal mesothelioma remains relatively unknown, but extrapolation of findings from their pleural counterpart would suggest frequent alterations in CDKN2A, NF2, and BAP1. […] Homozygous deletions in CDKN2A portend a worse overall survival in peritoneal mesothelioma. […] Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using CDKN2A and NF2 locus-specific probes and BAP1 immunohistochemistry identified homozygous CDKN2A deletions (n=25, 29%), hemizygous NF2 loss (n=30, 35%), and/or loss of BAP1 protein expression (n=49, 57%) in 68 of 86 (79%) peritoneal mesotheliomas. […] Homozygous CDKN2A deletions or hemizygous NF2 loss correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P&lt;0.02) and poor overall survival (P&lt;0.03). […] Patients harboring both homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss had a 2-year progression-free survival rate of 9% with a median of 6 months (P&lt;0.01) and overall survival rate of 18% with a median of 8 months (P&lt;0.01). […] By multivariate analysis, combined homozygous CDKN2A deletions and hemizygous NF2 loss was a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free survival and overall survival, independent of patient age, peritoneal cancer index, completeness of cytoreduction, and extent of invasion.

BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CDKN2A (p16) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have shown clinical utility in confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the role for using these 2 markers to guide clinical management is not yet clear. […] We performed CDKN2A FISH on a previously published tissue microarray on which we had performed BAP1 IHC, revealing combined BAP1/p16 status for 93 MPM cases. […] As expected, BAP1 IHC in combination with CDKN2A FISH resulted in high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (100%) for MPM, and p16 loss was an independent predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio, 2.2553; P = .0135). […] Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 IHC is not an independent predictor of prognosis, when viewed in combination with homozygous CDKN2A deletion, risk stratification was evident. […] More specifically, patients with CDKN2A disomy and loss of BAP1 expression had improved outcomes compared with those with CDKN2A disomy and retained BAP1 expression (hazard ratio, 0.2286; P = .0017), and this finding was notably evident among epithelioid cases.

[…] Patients with pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, CDKN2A, or DNA repair genes showed lower cumulative asbestos exposure than patients without germline variants in 94 cancer-predisposing genes (P = .00002).

Deletion of the CDKN2A locus is centrally involved in the development of several malignancies. […] However, the status of CDKN2A and the expression of the corresponding protein, p16, in relation to MPM patient’s asbestos exposure is poorly known. […] We studied DNA copy numbers for CDKN2A using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and p16 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 92 MPM patients, 75 of which with known asbestos exposure status. […] We found that an abnormal copy number of CDKN2A in MPM tumor cells associated with a high pulmonary asbestos fiber count (p = 0.044, Fisher’s Exact test, two-tailed). […] We found two instances where the gene locus CDKN2A or its corresponding protein expression, is associated with high asbestos exposure levels.

Mutations/deletions of <i>BAP1, CDKN2A</i>, and <i>NF2</i> are the most frequent genetic lesions in human malignant mesothelioma. […] While homozygous CKO of <i>Bap1, Cdkn2a</i>, or <i>Nf2</i> alone gave rise to few or no malignant mesotheliomas, inactivation of <i>Bap1</i> cooperated with loss of either <i>Nf2</i> or <i>Cdkn2a</i> to drive development of malignant mesothelioma in approximately 20% of double-CKO mice, and a high incidence (22/26, 85%) of malignant mesotheliomas was observed in <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> (triple)-CKO mice. […] Adenoviral-Cre treatment of normal mesothelial cells from <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> CKO mice, but not from mice with knockout of one or any two of these genes, resulted in robust spheroid formation <i>in vitro</i>, suggesting that mesothelial cells from <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> mice have stem cell-like potential. […] These data demonstrate that somatic inactivation of <i>Bap1, Nf2</i>, and <i>Cdkn2a</i> results in rapid, aggressive malignant mesotheliomas, and that deletion of <i>Bap1</i> contributes to tumor development, in part, by loss of PRC2-mediated repression of tumorigenic target genes and by acquisition of stem cell potential, suggesting a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. […] SIGNIFICANCE: Combinatorial deletions of <i>Bap1, Nf2</i>, and <i>Cdkn2a</i> result in aggressive mesotheliomas, with <i>Bap1</i> loss contributing to tumorigenesis by circumventing PRC2-mediated repression of oncogenic target genes.

The current diagnostic algorithm proceeds from BAP1 immunohistochemistry to CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization. […] While MTAP immunohistochemistry has recently shown promise as a surrogate for CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization, it has been examined in only a few single-institution studies. […] CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization data were available for a subset of cases, and a subset of cases was subjected in MTAP immunohistochemistry in multiple laboratories to assess interlaboratory reproducibility. […] MTAP loss by immunohistochemistry was 78% sensitive and 96% specific for CDKN2A homozygous deletion. […] MTAP immunohistochemistry is a reliable surrogate for CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization in diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. […] Rare cases with immunohistochemical MTAP loss may retain normal CDKN2A copy number, and the MTAP staining results should be correlated with clinicopathologic findings and other ancillary studies.
