To assess the immunoreactivity of malignant mesotheliomas for N- and E-cadherins, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and the tyrosine kinase receptors, met and erbB-2. […] Pleural malignant mesotheliomas were stained using a standard indirect immunoperoxidase method applied to paraffin sections. […] Malignant mesotheliomas were immunoreactive for N-cadherin (26/29; 90%), met (29/29; 100%) and erbB-2 (28/29; 97%). […] Signalling pathways mediated via met and erbB-2 may play a role in the growth and spread of malignant mesotheliomas.

After oligonucleotide microarray analysis (Affymetrix array) of normal rat pleural mesothelial (RPM) cells, RPM cells exposed to crocidolite asbestos, and rat mesotheliomas, subsets of genes that changed in expression were categorized, including the highly up-regulated, early response proto-oncogene, fra-1. […] Results reveal that induction of cd44 and c-met is causally linked to fra-1 expression, connecting fra-1 with genes governing cell motility and invasion in mesothelioma.

Early attempts at treatment and palliation with single agents such as doxorubicin met with low response rates and little clinical benefit.

Despite unquestionable improvement in the diagnostic methods at our disposal and the availability of new treatment strategies, the prognosis of MPM patients remains dramatically poor (12 to 18 months’ median survival from diagnosis), although exceptional cases of long-survivors are reported in all literature series. […] The current review will cover the dramatic improvements in the treatment of this rare disease that have been recently achieved, as well as the promise that new, molecular-targeted therapies, such as bortezomid, mTOR ( m ammalian t arget o f r apamycin) inhibitors, and Met inhibitors, seem to offer for the next few years.

Expression of the Met receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been observed in 74% to 100% and 40% to 85% of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) specimens, respectively. […] To investigate a potential therapeutic role for the Met receptor in MPM, we examined the effects of PHA-665752, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase, in a panel of 10 MPM cell lines. […] Evaluation of PHA-665752 across the 10 MPM cell lines indicated that despite Met expression in all cell lines, only in cell lines that exhibited a Met/HGF autocrine loop, H2461 and JMN-1B, did PHA-665752 inhibit growth with an IC(50) of 1 and 2 micromol/L, respectively. […] No activating mutations in Met were detected in any of the cell lines. […] Consistent with observed growth inhibition, PHA-665752 caused cell cycle arrest at G(1)-S boundary accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of Met, p70S6K, Akt, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. […] Growth of H2461 cells was also inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to HGF and by RNA interference knockdown of the Met receptor, confirming that growth inhibition observed was through a Met-dependent mechanism. […] Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of the Met receptor may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with MPM and provides a mechanism, the presence of a HGF/Met autocrine loop, by which to select patients for PHA-665752 treatment.

c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has not been extensively studied in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] In this study, c-Met was overexpressed and activated in most of the mesothelioma cell lines tested. […] Expression in MPM tissues by immunohistochemistry was increased (82%) in MPM in general compared with normal. c-Met was internalized with its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in H28 MPM cells, with robust expression of c-Met. […] Dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 &lt; 2.5 micromol/L) of cell growth in mesothelioma cell lines, but not in H2052, H2452, and nonmalignant MeT-5A (IC50 &gt; 10 micromol/L), was observed with the small-molecule c-Met inhibitor SU11274. […] Furthermore, migration of H28 cells was blocked with both SU11274 and c-Met small interfering RNA. […] Abrogation of HGF-induced c-Met and downstream signaling was seen in mesothelioma cells. […] Of the 43 MPM tissues and 7 cell lines, we have identified mutations within the semaphorin domain (N375S, M431V, and N454I), the juxtamembrane domain (T1010I and G1085X), and an alternative spliced product with deletion of the exon 10 of c-Met in some of the samples. […] Interestingly, we observed that the cell lines H513 and H2596 harboring the T1010I mutation exhibited the most dramatic reduction of cell growth with SU11274 when compared with wild-type H28 and nonmalignant MeT-5A cells. […] Ultimately, c-Met would be an important target for therapy against MPM.

[…] Pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin in this trial showed a 2.8-month gain in median survival compared with cisplatin alone in an intention-to-treat (ITT) population (12.1 and 9.3 months, respectively, p = 0.020, hazard ratio of 0.77). […] During the trial, increased reporting of severe toxicity in the pemetrexed arm led to a change in the protocol to add folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation to therapy. […] For fully supplemented patients (n = 331) the hazard ratio for median survival in favour of pemetrexed plus cisplatin was also comparable (0.75), but of borderline significance between treatment arms (p = 0.051). […] In the ITT population, the incidence of serious toxicities with pemetrexed plus cisplatin was higher compared with cisplatin alone. […] The economic evaluation conducted by the study (and that submitted by the manufacturer) suggested that pemetrexed is unlikely to be considered cost-effective at conventionally accepted thresholds in the UK for all patients, mainly because of the high cost of pemetrexed itself compared with cisplatin. […] The economic evaluation conducted in this study and that of the manufacturers suggest that pemetrexed is not cost-effective at conventional thresholds for all patients. […] Given the relatively small number of patients with mesothelioma, albeit increasing, the overall budget impact of pemetrexed would be unlikely to be more than pound5 million per year at present costs.

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET has been studied of a large variety of human cancers, including lung and mesothelioma. […] The MET receptor and its ligand HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) play important roles in cell growth, survival and migration, and dysregulation of the HGF-MET pathway leads to oncogenic changes including tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. […] In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), MET is dysregulated via overexpression, constitutive activation, gene amplification, ligand-dependent activation, mutation or epigenetic mechanisms. […] New drugs targeted against MET and HGF are currently being investigated in vitro and in vivo, with promising results. […] These drugs function at a variety of steps within the HGF-MET pathway, including MET expression at the RNA or protein level, the ligand-receptor interaction, and tyrosine kinase function. […] This paper will review the structure, function, mechanisms of tumorigenesis, and potential for therapeutic inhibition of the MET receptor in lung cancer and mesothelioma.

Although expression and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including MET, have been reported in most MPM, specific RTK inhibitors showed less than the expected response in MPM cells. […] To determine whether the lack of response of MET inhibitors was due to cooperation with other RTKs, we determined activation status of MET and other RTKs, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of 20 MPM cell lines, and tested whether dual RTK inhibition is an effective therapeutic strategy. […] We detected MET upregulation and phosphorylation (thus indicating activation) in 14 (70%) and 13 (65%) cell lines, but treatment with MET-specific inhibitors showed weak or modest effect of suppression in most of the cell lines.

NK4 exhibits two distinct biological actions: antagonistic inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) through binding to the Met/HGF receptor, and antiangiogenic action through binding to perlecan. […] In addition, NK4 but not anti-HGF antibody suppressed proliferation of EHMES-10 cells in collagen, suggesting that the suppression by NK4 was independent of the HGF-Met pathway. […] Analysis of Met receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, proliferation, apoptosis and blood vessels in the tumor tissues indicated that the inhibitory effect of NK4 expression might be primarily caused by the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. […] In all the 7 mesothelioma lines, HGF stimulated Met tyrosine phosphorylation, and this was associated with enhanced cell migration.

By regulating cell functions such as growth, survival, motility/migration, and invasion, the c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (c-MET) receptor tyrosine kinase/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) axis accounts for a critical pathway in malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Overall survival correlations of c-MET and phospho-c-MET immunostainings were investigated in 157 malignant pleural mesothelioma patients for whom paraffin-embedded specimens were referred to our center for pathological diagnosis certification (MESOPATH French National group). […] Subcellular localization of the activated c-MET receptor after HGF stimulation was assessed in nontumorogenic cell lines. […] Positive c-MET expression was found in 119 samples (75.8%), more frequently in the epithelioid subtype (p &lt; 0.0001). […] Among those 119 positive c-MET specimens, 77 (64.7%) were also positive for phospho-c-MET. […] Both c-MET and phospho-c-MET scoring were independent of patient gender or age. […] Phospho-c-MET scoring or localization did not associate with survival. […] Conversely, patients with a c-MET immunohistochemical staining intensity higher than 1, but exclusively confined to plasma membrane, had a median overall survival of 25 months versus 13 months for all other patients. […] Using the HBEC3 immortalized epithelial cell lines treated with HGF, we showed the physiological relevance of phospho-c-MET nuclear translocation. […] Our results lighten that, disregarding the intracellular c-MET receptor traffic, only c-MET plasma membrane localization could be a relevant prognosis biomarker in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

[…] In this study, we investigated expression and signaling of PAR1 in nonmalignant pleural mesothelial (Met-5A) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (NCI-H28) cells. […] We found that the expression level of PAR1 was markedly higher in NCI-H28 cells compared to Met-5A and human primary mesothelial cells. […] REN, Ist-Mes2, and Mero-14, did not show any significant PAR1 over-expression compared to Met-5A cell line. […] Thrombin and PAR1 activating peptides enhanced Met-5A and NCI-H28 cell proliferation but in NCI-H28 cells higher thrombin concentrations were required to obtain the same proliferation increase. […] We also determined that PAR1 signaling through Gq and G12/13 proteins is severely altered in NCI-H28 cells compared to Met-5A cells.

Because previous studies reported high c-Met expression and alterations in the microtubules network in most MPM samples, we evaluated the activity of tivantinib, which has been recently suggested to affect microtubule polymerization in addition to inhibiting c-Met. […] In four MPM cell lines tivantinib inhibited both c-Met activity and microtubule polymerization, resulting in inhibition of cell-growth with IC50s ranging between 0.3 µM (MSTO-211H) and 2.4 µM (H2052). […] Furthermore tivantinib synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of pemetrexed, as detected by sulforhodamine-B-assay and flow cytometry. […] In aggregate, these data show the ability of tivantinib to specifically target key pathways in MPM cells and synergistically interact with pemetrexed, supporting further studies on this therapeutic approach.

[…] Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed using probes for MET and centromere 7. […] One hundred thirty patients died of disease; 2 were alive with disease. c-Met was expressed in 147 MPMs. c-Met staining intensity, distribution, and H-score differed among the histologic subtypes (P=.015; P=.0001, and P=.0005, respectively), but none were predictive of survival. […] Epithelioid subtype had greater c-Met expression. […] MET amplification was identified in 1 sarcomatoid MPM and MET duplication in 1 epithelioid MPM; both had poor outcomes.

This study investigated the expression and DNA methylation of <i>SFRP</i> genes in MPM cells lines with and without demethylation treatment. […] Sixty-six patient FFPE samples were analysed and have showed methylation of <i>SFRP2</i> (56%) and <i>SFRP5</i> (70%) in MPM. <i>SFRP2</i> and <i>SFRP5</i> tumour-suppressive activity in eleven MPM lines was confirmed, and long-term asbestos exposure led to reduced expression of the <i>SFRP1</i> and <i>SFRP</i>2 genes in the mesothelium (MeT-5A) via epigenetic alterations. […] Finally, DNA methylation of <i>SFRP</i>s is detectable in MPM patient plasma samples, with methylated <i>SFRP2</i> and <i>SFRP5</i> showing a tendency towards greater abundance in patients. […] These data suggested that <i>SFRP</i> genes have tumour-suppresive activity in MPM and that methylated DNA from <i>SFRP</i> gene promoters has the potential to serve as a biomarker for MPM patient plasma.

Here, we examined ALK, MET and mTOR as potential therapeutic targets and determined the combinatorial efficacy of ALK and mTOR targeting on tumor cell growth <i>in vivo</i>. […] First, <i>ALK</i> overexpression, rearrangement and mutation were studied in primary MPM by qRT-PCR, FISH, immunohistochemistry and sequence analysis; <i>mTOR</i> and <i>MET</i> expression by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. […] Overexpression of full-length <i>ALK</i> transcripts was observed in 25 (19.5%) of 128 primary MPM, of which ten expressed ALK protein. <i>ALK</i> overexpression was not associated with gene rearrangement, amplification or kinase-domain mutation. mTOR protein was detected in 28.7% MPM, co-expressed with ALK or MET in 5% and 15% MPM, respectively. […] The ALK/MET inhibitor crizotinib enhanced the anti-tumor effect of the mTOR-inhibitor rapamycin in a patient-derived MPM xenograft with co-activated ALK/mTOR: combined therapy achieved tumor shrinkage in 4/5 tumors and growth stagnation in one tumor.

The receptor tyrosine kinase MET is frequently involved in malignant transformation and inhibiting its activity in MET-dependent cancers is associated with improved clinical outcomes. […] Here, we report that inhibiting MET activity with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor MGCD516 attenuates viability, migration, and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines <i>in vitro</i>, and significantly retards tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. […] Furthermore, inhibiting MET pharmacologically or knocking down its expression using siRNA, decreases DRP1 activity alluding to possible crosstalk between them in these two cancers. […] Considered together, the present study has uncovered a novel mechanism underlying mitochondrial regulation by MET that involves crosstalk with DRP1, and suggests that a combination therapy targeting both MET and DRP1 could be a novel strategy for NSCLC and MPM.

These meetings often feature presentations given by medical doctors or, in the case of research-focussed organisations, by research scientists.Receiving feedback from people who are confused and sometimes upset by some types of information, and the way it is presented at meetings, made us think about better ways for researchers to discuss their ideas for new research, or share the findings from completed projects, with patients and members of the public.This article describes a method of public engagement called “Meet the Researchers” that enables people to hear about current trends in research face to face with the researchers planning or conducting it. “Meet the Researchers” is designed to promote discussion and allow questions to be asked in a relaxed and informal way, in small groups, which is less daunting than asking questions in front of a conference audience. […] Additionally we aim to improve understanding of how results are passed on to doctors and nurses and translated into improvements in patient care.The method was tested with patients and was rated very highly by them in the feedback they gave. <b>Background</b> Innovative approaches to engaging people with science exist but are often framed around interactive events or social media technologies. […] In the case of research-focussed organisations, these meetings often take the form of presentations delivered by clinical experts or research scientists.Observation of mesothelioma patients, their relatives, friends and carers attending scientific or clinical-themed meetings has shown that they can be confused, and sometimes distressed, by presentations. […] This experience motivated the development of a less formal method of sharing complex information and ideas in a simplified manner. “Meet the Researchers” aims to make researchers accessible to patients in order to raise awareness and understanding of research and to explain how research translates into, and informs practice. […] This approach encourages the use of plain English, removes the tendency to rely on PowerPoint slides to convey the message and moreover, provides an opportunity for researchers to hear patients’ views. <b>Methods</b> Small groups of participants met face to face with the researchers planning or conducting research into their condition, and discussed the topics in a relaxed and informal way. […] Info-graphics on a portable device or printed hand-outs in plain English were allowed but no formal presentations were made. <b>Results</b> Our method has been evaluated using feedback data from three annual events held from 2016 to 2018: 100% of participants indicated that they liked the format “very much”(76.0%) or “quite a lot”(24.0%); 80.4% found the topics “very interesting” and 75.9% found it “very easy” to ask questions.

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) stimulates cell proliferation, motility and invasiveness via its receptor c-Met during embryogenesis and repair processes. […] Co-expression of HGF/SF and c-Met receptor results in enhanced tumour growth, invasiveness and a mesenchymal-epithelial transition in some experimental tumours. […] Since mesothelioma cells have been reported to express c-Met receptor and to migrate in response to HGF/SF, we investigated human malignant pleural mesotheliomas for the demonstration of possible co-expression of the growth factor and its receptor. […] Thirty-nine paraffin-embedded specimens of malignant pleural mesotheliomas were immunostained by anti-HGF/SF and anti-c-Met antibodies and semiquantitatively evaluated. c-Met mRNA expression was visualised in ten tumour samples by a fluorescent in situ hybridisation method. […] We found an increased production of HGF/SF in 33/39 tumours and a corresponding overexpression of c-Met receptor in 29/39 specimens. […] The FISH method detected increased transcription of c-Met mRNA in malignant cells and in neighbouring vascular endothelial cells. […] The observed co-expression of HGF/SF and c-Met in malignant pleural mesotheliomas suggests a possible self-stimulation (autocrine loop) of tumour cells.
