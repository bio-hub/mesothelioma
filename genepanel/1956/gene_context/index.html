Approximately 70% of MPMs have high levels of expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and a subset of cell lines derived from MPM patients express both EGFR and transforming growth factor alpha, suggesting an autocrine role for EGFR in MPM. […] We have determined the effects of EGFR inhibition in MPM cell lines in vitro, using four MPM cell lines derived from previously untreated patients with epithelial (H2461 and H2591), sarcomatoid (H2373), and biphasic (MSTO-211H) MPM. […] All four cell lines expressed EGFR at levels comparable with the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line A549, as shown by Western blot analysis. […] This variability in growth-inhibitory effects is not related to the amount of EGFR present on MPM cells or to the degree of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by ZD1839.

We examined 24 peritoneal and nine pleural malignant mesotheliomas with a battery of immunohistochemical markers (cytokeratin AE1/3, calretinin, c-kit/CD117, desmin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), MIB-1, and cleaved caspase-3) in an attempt to distinguish any differences in this tumor arising in these two distinct locations. […] The results indicate that the only marker to show a significant difference in its staining pattern between these two sites was EGFR (P=0.0004). […] In all, 92% (22/24) of peritoneal tumors demonstrated 3+ or 4+ immunoreactivity with EGFR, opposed to only 33% (3/9) pleural tumors. […] The EGFR expression is more pronounced in peritoneal tumors compared to pleural tumors. […] The increased expression of EGFR in the peritoneal lesions may be of clinical significance with the recent emergence of epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapies.

Approximately 70% of malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM) overexpress epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and a subset express both EGFR and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), suggesting an autocrine role for EGFR in MPM. […] We checked on MPM cells (10 human cell lines, 11 primary cultures obtained by human biopsies, and 7 short-term normal mesothelial cell cultures) concerning the following: (a) the relative overexpression of EGFR (Western blotting, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry), (b) the relative expression of EGFR ligands (EGF, amphiregulin, TGF-alpha, ELISA), (c) the relative increase of the activated form of Ras (Ras-bound GTP) after EGF stimulation (Ras activation assay), (d) the efficacy of five different FTIs (HDJ2 prenylation, cell cytotoxicity, and apoptosis using ApopTag and gel ladder). […] EGFR was overexpressed in MPM cells compared with normal pleural mesothelial cells in equivalent levels as in non-small cell lung cancer cells A459. […] MPM cells constitutively expressed EGFR ligands; however, Ras activation was attenuated at high EGF concentrations (100 ng/mL).

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B conducted a phase II study of gefitinib, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, in patients with previously untreated malignant mesothelioma. […] EGFR expression score by immunohistochemistry done in 28 patients was categorized as low (EGFR 1+ or 2+) or high (EGFR 3+) expression: 97% had EGFR overexpression (2+ or 3+). […] The median and 3-month failure-free survival were 3.6 months and 40% for those patients with low EGFR expression compared with 8.1 and 40% for those with high EGFR expression. […] Although 97% of patients with mesothelioma had EGFR overexpression, gefitinib was not active in malignant mesothelioma. […] EGFR expression does not correlate with failure-free survival.

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies, against which some antitumoral drugs have been developed. […] There is a lack of information as to EGFR expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive and fatal cancer poorly responsive to current oncological treatments. […] Our aim was to: (a) compare EGFR immunohistochemical expression with mRNA levels measured by real time PCR; (b) assess the relationships between EGFR expression and clinico-pathological data including survival; (c) analyze the EGFR mutations. […] We developed an immunohistochemical method of EGFR evaluation based on the number of immunoreactive cells and staining intensity in 61 MPMs. […] EGFR immunoreactivity was documented in 34/61 (55.7%) cases. […] A significant correlation between EGFR protein and mRNA levels (p = 0.0077) was found, demonstrating the reliability of our quantification method of EGFR membrane expression. […] No statistical correlation between EGFR immunoreactivity and patients survival was observed. […] No EGFR mutation was documented. […] This study documents EGFR overexpression in MPM at the protein and the transcriptional levels; it proposes a reliable method for EGFR expression evaluation in MPM. […] EGFR levels are not associated with clinico-pathological features of patients, including survival.

Yet neither the spectrum of tissue expression nor the signalling pathways of OPN in MM and pulmonary adenocarcinoma have been characterized, although in vitro evidence links OPN to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. […] OPN expression was investigated immunohistochemically in 104 adenocarcinomas and 38 MM and correlated with histological features, including tumour type, grade and proliferation and with expression of activated intermediary EGFR signalling pathway molecules p65, p-AKT, p-ERK, p-STAT-3, and of metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. […] Frequent OPN expression is typical of, but not specific for MM, whereas it appears to select adenocarcinoma cases with p65 and MMP-9 expression, suggesting a link with EGFR signalling pathways.

[…] EGFR was highly expressed in 75% of patient tumors, as was phospho-ERK (82%), phospho-Akt (84%), phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (74%), and phospho-forkhead (74%).

Both malignant tumors expressed high levels of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), with membranous staining on the majority of malignant cells corresponding to maximum IHC scores of 290 and 300, respectively, for the MM and the ACL. […] SKs revealed a universal membranous staining throughout the entire epithelium with no difference in EGFR expression between the two cases and two controls with no malignant history. […] By fluorescence in situ hybridization, no amplification of the EGFR gene in malignant tumors as well as in SK lesions was observed. […] Further investigations are needed to see whether tumor-associated EGFR ligands/EGFR autocrine loops in malignant cells expressing high levels of EGFR protein on the surface might play a role for the development of SKs, as well as for the growth of malignant tumors in LT.

We previously reported that PDT transiently activates EGFR/STAT3 in lung and ovarian cancer cells and inhibiting EGFR via erlotinib can increase PDT sensitivity. […] Additionally, we have seen higher EGFR expression associating with worse outcomes after Photofrin-mediated PDT for MPM, and the extensive desmoplastic reaction associated with MPM influences tumor phenotype and therapeutic response. […] Using these models, we confirmed that EGFR inhibition increases PDT cytotoxicity. […] Together with emerging evidence that EGFR inhibition may improve survival of lung cancer patients through immunologic and direct cell killing mechanisms, these results suggest erlotinib-enhanced PDT may significantly improve outcomes for MPM patients.

[…] While many anti-EGFR therapies have failed to show significant efficacy in the management of MM, the pathway is biologically active and its abrogation preclinically points toward it being a valid target.
