To identify additional driver genes, we used an integrated genomic analysis of 53 MPM tumor samples to guide a focused sequencing effort that uncovered somatic inactivating mutations in BAP1 in 23% of MPMs. […] The BAP1 nuclear deubiquitinase is known to target histones (together with ASXL1 as a Polycomb repressor subunit) and the HCF1 transcriptional co-factor, and we show that BAP1 knockdown in MPM cell lines affects E2F and Polycomb target genes.

We discovered germline mutations in the gene encoding BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) in two families with a high incidence of mesothelioma, and we observed somatic alterations affecting BAP1 in familial mesotheliomas, indicating biallelic inactivation. […] In addition to mesothelioma, some BAP1 mutation carriers developed uveal melanoma. […] We also found germline BAP1 mutations in 2 of 26 sporadic mesotheliomas; both individuals with mutant BAP1 were previously diagnosed with uveal melanoma. […] We also observed somatic truncating BAP1 mutations and aberrant BAP1 expression in sporadic mesotheliomas without germline mutations. […] These results identify a BAP1-related cancer syndrome that is characterized by mesothelioma and uveal melanoma.

Recent work has focused on the frequent somatic inactivation of two tumor suppressor genes in MPM-NF2 (Neurofibromatosis type 2) and the recently identified BAP1 (BRCA associated protein 1).

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/alternative reading frame (CDKN2A/ARF), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) genes are the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes detected in MM cells; the alterations of the latter two are relatively characteristic of MM. […] BAP1 is involved in histone modification and its inactivation induces the disturbance of global gene expression profiling. […] The discovery of a new familial cancer syndrome with germline mutation of BAP1 also indicates the importance of genetic factors in MM susceptibility.

By combining whole-exome sequencing and tumor profiling in a family prone to cases of RCC, we identified a germline BAP1 mutation c.277A&gt;G (p.Thr93Ala) as the probable genetic basis of RCC predisposition. […] Furthermore, BAP1 was found to be inactivated in RCC-affected individuals from this family. […] No BAP1 mutations were identified in 32 familial cases presenting with only RCC. […] We then screened for germline BAP1 deleterious mutations in familial aggregations of cancers within the spectrum of the recently described BAP1-associated tumor predisposition syndrome, including uveal melanoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, and cutaneous melanoma. […] Among the 11 families that included individuals identified as carrying germline deleterious BAP1 mutations, 6 families presented with 9 RCC-affected individuals, demonstrating a significantly increased risk for RCC. […] This strongly argues that RCC belongs to the BAP1 syndrome and that BAP1 is a RCC-predisposition gene.

We describe a new family with a novel germline BAP1 nonsense mutation, c.723T&gt;G, which leads to a predicted truncated protein, p.Y241*, or nonsense-mediated decay of the BAP1 mRNA. […] The findings in this family provide further support for the existence of a BAP1 cancer syndrome that predisposes to MM, various melanocytic neoplasms, and potentially other cancers. […] The fact that several members of the family manifested two or more different types of cancer suggests widespread BAP1-related tumor susceptibility targeting tissues of multiple organs. […] In addition, a review of BAP1 cancer syndrome families reported to date indicates that the location of the BAP1 mutation does not have any bearing on the spectrum of cancer types observed, either for mesothelial or melanocytic tumors.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently lost in MPM. […] Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to several different tumors including malignant mesothelioma. […] Our study aimed to clarify if asbestos exposure has an influence on BAP1 expression and if BAP1 expression could be used as a prognostic factor of outcome. […] An immunohistochemical staining for BAP1 was performed on 123 MPM tissue samples and the expression levels have been correlated with asbestos exposure and overall survival time. […] BAP1 expression was not associated with asbestos exposure but we detected a significant effect of BAP1 expression on overall survival time–the higher the BAP1 expression (non-mutated BAP1), the shorter the overall survival. […] BAP1 mutation has been linked to non-asbestos induced familial mesotheliomas, which usually belong to the long survivor group and BAP1 is most probably functioning differently than in sporadic cases. […] Further investigations need to be performed to characterize the BAP1 mutations and to identify the BAP1 downstream targets in MPM.

Genomic studies of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have recently identified frequent mutations in the BRCA-associated protein 1(BAP1) gene. […] In uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, BAP1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes but their clinical significance in MPM is unknown. […] We therefore undertook this study to define the characteristics of patients whose MPM tumors harbor somatic BAP1 mutation and to examine the relationship between BAP1 mutation and survival. […] We reviewed the charts of 121 patients with MPM tumors diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 tested for BAP1 mutation, and extracted the following information: age at diagnosis, sex, histology, stage, smoking status, asbestos exposure, family or personal history of malignancy, and treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation as well as survival status. […] Twenty-four of the 121 tumors (20%) harbored somatic BAP1 mutations. […] The percentage of current or former smokers among cases with BAP1 mutations was significantly higher than in BAP1 wild-type cases, (75% versus 42%; p = 0.006). […] However, the types of nucleotide substitutions in BAP1 did not suggest that this association was because of a causative role of smoking in BAP1 mutations. […] No other clinical feature was significantly different among those with and without BAP1 mutations in their MPM. […] There was also no difference in survival according to somatic BAP1 mutation status. […] There is no apparent distinct clinical phenotype for MPM with somatic BAP1 mutation. […] The significance of the more frequent history of smoking among patients with BAP1-mutated MPM warrants further study.

BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) mutations cause a new cancer syndrome, with a high rate of malignant mesothelioma (MM). […] Here, we tested the hypothesis that MM associated with germline BAP1 mutations has a better prognosis compared with sporadic MM. […] We compared survival among germline BAP1 mutation MM patients with that of all MM (N = 10 556) recorded in the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1973 to 2010. […] We identified 23 MM patients–11 alive–with germline BAP1 mutations and available data on survival. […] Actuarial median survival for the MM patients with germline BAP1 mutations was 5 years, as compared with &lt;1 year for the median survival in the United States SEER MM group. […] Analysis of the pooled cohort of germline BAP1 mutation MM showed that patients with peritoneal MM (median survival of 10 years, P = 0.0571), or with a second malignancy in addition to MM (median survival of 10 years, P = 0.0716), survived for a longer time compared with patients who only had pleural MM, or MM patients without a second malignancy, respectively. […] In conclusion, we found that MM patients with germline BAP1 mutations have an overall 7-fold increased long-term survival, independently of sex and age. […] Appropriate genetic counseling and clinical management should be considered for MM patients who are also BAP1 mutation carriers.

23% of mesothelioma tumor specimens have a mutation in the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene and germline BAP1 mutations predispose to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

[…] However, the reported frequency of somatic BAP1 mutations in MM varies considerably, a discrepancy that appeared related to either methodological or ethnical differences across various studies. […] To address this discrepancy, we carried out comprehensive genomic and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to detect somatic BAP1 gene alterations in 22 frozen MM biopsies from U.S. […] By combining Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, copy number analysis, and cDNA sequencing, we found alteration of BAP1 in 14 of 22 biopsies (63.6%). […] IHC revealed normal nuclear BAP1 staining in the eight MM containing wild-type BAP1, whereas no nuclear staining was detected in the 14 MM biopsies containing tumor cells with mutated BAP1.

Previously, pleural MMs have been genetically characterized by the loss of BAP1 (40-60%) as well as loss of NF2 (75%) and CDKN2A (60%).

[…] BAP1 was the only recurrently mutated gene (N = 3/7). […] In one additional case, loss of the entire chromosome 3 leaves a non-functional copy of BAP1 carrying a rare nonsense germline variant, thus suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in this patient. […] Finally, with targeted sequencing of BAP1 in 3 additional cases, we conclude that BAP1 is frequently altered through copy number losses (N = 3/12), mutations (N = 3/12) or both (N = 2/12) sometimes at a sub-clonal level.

Through an unbiased siRNA screen we found that BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) regulates their expression, with HDAC2 reduced and HDAC1 increased in BAP1 depleted cells. […] BAP1 loss-of-function is increasingly reported in cancers including thoracic malignancies, with frequent mutation in malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Endogenous HDAC2 directly correlates with BAP1 across a panel of lung cancer cell lines, and is downregulated in mesothelioma cell lines with genetic BAP1 inactivation. […] We find that BAP1 regulates HDAC2 by increasing transcript abundance, rather than opposing its ubiquitylation. […] Importantly, although total cellular HDAC activity is unaffected by transient depletion of HDAC2 or of BAP1 due to HDAC1 compensation, this isoenzyme imbalance sensitizes MSTO-211H cells to HDAC inhibitors.

[…] BAP1 stain was also performed in 70 cytological samples (45 mesotheliomas and 25 reactive mesothelial proliferations). […] BAP1 was expressed in all benign mesothelial tumors, whereas 139/212 (66%) mesotheliomas were BAP1 negative, especially in epithelioid/biphasic compared with sarcomatoid/desmoplastic subtypes (69% vs 15%). […] BAP1 loss was homogeneous in neoplastic cells except for two epithelioid mesotheliomas showing tumor heterogeneity. […] By fluorescence in situ hybridization, BAP1 protein loss was paralleled by homozygous deletion of the BAP1 locus in the vast majority of BAP1-negative tumors (31/41, 76%), whereas 9/10 BAP1-positive mesotheliomas were normal. […] In biopsies interpreted as reactive mesothelial proliferation BAP1 loss was 100% predictive of malignancy, as all 6 cases subsequently developed BAP1-negative mesothelioma, whereas only 3/36 (8%) BAP1-positive cases progressed to mesothelioma. […] On cytology/cell blocks, benign mesothelial cells were invariably positive for BAP1, whereas 64% of mesotheliomas showed loss of protein; all 6 cases showing BAP1 negativity were associated with histological diagnosis of BAP1-negative mesothelioma. […] BAP1 stain also showed utility in the differential of mesothelioma from most common pleural and peritoneal mimickers, such as lung and ovary carcinomas, with specificity and sensitivity of 99/70% and 100/70%, respectively. […] Our results show that BAP1 protein is frequently lost in mesothelioma, especially of epithelioid/biphasic subtype and is commonly associated with homozygous BAP1 deletion. […] BAP1 immunostain represents an excellent biomarker with an unprecedented specificity (100%) in the distinction between benign and malignant mesothelial proliferations.

[…] We investigated the presence and frequency of gross genomic rearrangements in the BAP1 gene by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 17 Japanese cases of MM tumors. […] We found five tumors with partial deletion of BAP1 gene; each tumors displayed partial deletion of exons 1-4 (MM39), exons 1-5 (MM48), exons 11-17 (MM57), exons 1-15 (MM19) and exons 1-16 (MM21).

[…] BAP1 was lost in 77% of epithelioid cases (n=58) but was retained in all sarcomatoid cases (n=10); 49% of biphasic cases showed loss (n=43), and BAP1-negative cases demonstrated loss of staining in both the epithelioid and sarcomatoid components. […] All non-neoplastic mesothelial tissues (n=20) retained BAP1, resulting in a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 61%, 100%, 100%, and 32%, respectively. […] Moreover, BAP1 expression in spindled mesothelium enabled discrimination of reactive and malignant cells, thus providing a more objective means of distinguishing epithelioid from biphasic morphology compared to histology alone. […] Nonetheless, BAP1 staining was patchy in some benign mesothelial neoplasms, which raises concern for using BAP1 in small biopsies. […] Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival with BAP1 loss, but this did not reach significance in multivariate analysis accounting for histologic subtype.

Recent data identified BRCA1-associated protein 1 gene (BAP1) as one of the most frequently mutated genes in MPM. […] Immunohistochemical testing for BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) has been proposed to be predictive for the detection of BAP1 mutation in neoplastic cells. […] The aim of the present study was to define the diagnostic usefulness of immunohistochemical determination of BAP1 in MPM, with clinicopathological correlation. […] A series of 143 MPMs were investigated for BAP1 protein expression in correlation with clinical and pathological data, including with a newly proposed nuclear grade. […] A pilot series of 20 selected cases were also investigated for BAP1 mutational status. […] Negative nuclear staining for BAP1 occurred in 62% of MPMs (including 27% with a cytoplasmic pattern) and was significantly associated with the presence of BAP1 mutation, epithelioid subtype, and a better prognosis. […] In a subgroup of cases, the pattern of expression of BAP1 in stromal cells supported their distinction as reactive versus neoplastic, thus helping achieve the correct classification of biphasic histological subtype. […] We showed that BAP1 protein determination is a diagnostic tool to correctly distinguish biphasic MPM from epithelial subtypes with an atypical/activated reactive stroma and an independent prognostic parameter in MPM.

BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CDKN2A (p16) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have shown clinical utility in confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the role for using these 2 markers to guide clinical management is not yet clear. […] Although p16 loss is predictive of poor prognosis, there is controversy as to whether BAP1 loss is predictive of a more favorable prognosis; how these results interact with one another has not been explored. […] We performed CDKN2A FISH on a previously published tissue microarray on which we had performed BAP1 IHC, revealing combined BAP1/p16 status for 93 MPM cases. […] As expected, BAP1 IHC in combination with CDKN2A FISH resulted in high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (100%) for MPM, and p16 loss was an independent predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio, 2.2553; P = .0135). […] There was no association between BAP1 loss and p16 loss, as 26%, 28%, 30%, and 16% of overall cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 alone, loss of p16 alone, loss of both BAP1 and p16, or neither abnormality, respectively. […] Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 IHC is not an independent predictor of prognosis, when viewed in combination with homozygous CDKN2A deletion, risk stratification was evident. […] More specifically, patients with CDKN2A disomy and loss of BAP1 expression had improved outcomes compared with those with CDKN2A disomy and retained BAP1 expression (hazard ratio, 0.2286; P = .0017), and this finding was notably evident among epithelioid cases. […] We conclude that BAP1 IHC provides prognostic information within the context of CDKN2A FISH that may have clinical utility beyond diagnosis.

BRCA1 associated protein1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification by deubiquitinating histone 2A, and DNA repair. […] BAP1 mutations are frequent in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Our aim was to functionally characterize a newly identified isoform of BAP1 and investigate the effects of its expression on drug sensitivity in MPM. […] Expression of BAP1 isoforms was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in MPM and normal mesothelium cell lines and tumor and nontumor samples. […] Subcellular localization of BAP1 isoforms was examined by immunofluorescence. […] We have identified a novel alternative splice isoform of BAP1 (BAP1Δ) that misses part of the catalytic domain. […] Cells transfected with BAP1Δ showed reduced deubiquitinating activity compared with full-length BAP1. […] The expression of BAP1Δ transcript is more abundant in nontumor than in tumor samples. […] MPM cell lines expressing more than 20% of BAP1Δ are more sensitive to olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) cytotoxicity, and this sensitivity is enhanced when olaparib treatment is combined with GDC0980 (a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor), which induces downregulation of BRCA1. […] These observations suggest that BAP1Δ does regulate DNA damage response and influences drug sensitivity.

[…] The authors examined IHC expression of MTAP and BAP1 in cell blocks obtained from pleural effusions of 45 cases of MPM and 21 cases of reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. […] MTAP and BAP1 IHC differentiated MPM from RMC with 100% specificity for both and sensitivities of 42.2% and 60.0%, respectively. […] The combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC yielded a sensitivity of 77.8%, which was higher than that of BAP1 IHC alone or 9p21 FISH alone (62.2%). […] A combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC in cell blocks from pleural effusions appears to be a reliable and useful method for differentiating MPM cells from RMC and can be used in the routine diagnosis of MPM.

BAP1 is a tumour suppressor gene commonly mutated in MM. […] Germline BAP1 mutation has been associated with early onset and less aggressive disease compared with sporadic MM. […] Sporadic BAP1 mutations are common and are associated with improved survival in MM, contrary to other malignancies. […] This study investigated the prognostic role of BAP1 in matched cytology and surgical specimens and aimed to investigate the association between BAP1 and the established prognostic marker VEGFA from a cohort of 81 patients. […] BAP1 mutation was found in 58% of histology and 59% of cytology specimens. […] Loss of BAP1 expression in both surgical and cytology specimens was significantly associated with poorer survival in a multivariate analysis when controlling for known prognostic indicators. […] We conclude that the prognostic significance of BAP1 mutations in MM cannot be determined in isolation of other prognostic factors, which may vary between patients. […] Pathologists should employ caution when commenting on prognostic implications of BAP1 status of MM patients in diagnostic pathology reports, but it may be useful for early diagnosis.

Loss of BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) protein expression as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and homozygous deletion (HD) of the 9p21 locus as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) permits differentiation of MPM from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH). […] In the current study, we investigated whether EZH2 IHC assay, alone or in combination with BAP1 and MTAP IHC, is useful for distinguishing MPM from RMH. […] We examined IHC expression of EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP, and 9p21 FISH in MPM (n = 38) and RMH (n = 29) and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of each detection assay for distinguishing MPM from RMH. […] EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP IHC, and 9p21 FISH were characterized by a 100% specificity each and 44.7%, 52.6%, 47.4%, and 65.8% sensitivities, respectively. […] A combination of EZH2 and BAP1 IHC, and 9p21 FISH showed the greatest sensitivity (89.5%). […] Using IHC alone (EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP IHC) also yielded a good sensitivity of 86.9%; this level is high enough for routine diagnostics. […] There were no statistically significant associations between expression of EZH2 and that of other markers (BAP1 and MTAP IHC) or 9p21 HD. […] In conclusion, adding a high expression level of EZH2 to a combination of BAP1 and MTAP loss, all detected by IHC, demonstrated useful for discriminating MPM from RMH.

Mutations/deletions of <i>BAP1, CDKN2A</i>, and <i>NF2</i> are the most frequent genetic lesions in human malignant mesothelioma. […] We introduced various combinations of these deletions in the pleura of conditional knockout (CKO) mice, focusing on the contribution of <i>Bap1</i> loss. […] While homozygous CKO of <i>Bap1, Cdkn2a</i>, or <i>Nf2</i> alone gave rise to few or no malignant mesotheliomas, inactivation of <i>Bap1</i> cooperated with loss of either <i>Nf2</i> or <i>Cdkn2a</i> to drive development of malignant mesothelioma in approximately 20% of double-CKO mice, and a high incidence (22/26, 85%) of malignant mesotheliomas was observed in <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> (triple)-CKO mice. […] Adenoviral-Cre treatment of normal mesothelial cells from <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> CKO mice, but not from mice with knockout of one or any two of these genes, resulted in robust spheroid formation <i>in vitro</i>, suggesting that mesothelial cells from <i>Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a</i> mice have stem cell-like potential. […] RNA-seq analysis of malignant mesotheliomas from triple-CKO mice revealed enrichment of genes transcriptionally regulated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and others previously implicated in known Bap1-related cellular processes. […] These data demonstrate that somatic inactivation of <i>Bap1, Nf2</i>, and <i>Cdkn2a</i> results in rapid, aggressive malignant mesotheliomas, and that deletion of <i>Bap1</i> contributes to tumor development, in part, by loss of PRC2-mediated repression of tumorigenic target genes and by acquisition of stem cell potential, suggesting a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. […] SIGNIFICANCE: Combinatorial deletions of <i>Bap1, Nf2</i>, and <i>Cdkn2a</i> result in aggressive mesotheliomas, with <i>Bap1</i> loss contributing to tumorigenesis by circumventing PRC2-mediated repression of oncogenic target genes.
