&lt;strong&gt;Summary Entrez&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This gene belongs to the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase subfamily of deubiquitinating enzymes that are involved in the removal of ubiquitin from proteins. The encoded enzyme binds to the breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) via the RING finger domain of the latter and acts as a tumor suppressor. In addition, the enzyme may be involved in regulation of transcription, regulation of cell cycle and growth, response to DNA damage and chromatin dynamics. Germline mutations in this gene may be associated with tumor predisposition syndrome (TPDS), which involves increased risk of cancers including malignant mesothelioma, uveal melanoma and cutaneous melanoma.

To identify additional driver genes, we used an integrated genomic analysis of 53 MPM tumor samples to guide a focused sequencing effort that uncovered somatic inactivating mutations in BAP1 in 23% of MPMs. […] The BAP1 nuclear deubiquitinase is known to target histones (together with ASXL1 as a Polycomb repressor subunit) and the HCF1 transcriptional co-factor, and we show that BAP1 knockdown in MPM cell lines affects E2F and Polycomb target genes.

We discovered germline mutations in the gene encoding BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) in two families with a high incidence of mesothelioma, and we observed somatic alterations affecting BAP1 in familial mesotheliomas, indicating biallelic inactivation. […] In addition to mesothelioma, some BAP1 mutation carriers developed uveal melanoma. […] We also found germline BAP1 mutations in 2 of 26 sporadic mesotheliomas; both individuals with mutant BAP1 were previously diagnosed with uveal melanoma. […] We also observed somatic truncating BAP1 mutations and aberrant BAP1 expression in sporadic mesotheliomas without germline mutations. […] These results identify a BAP1-related cancer syndrome that is characterized by mesothelioma and uveal melanoma.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

Recent work has focused on the frequent somatic inactivation of two tumor suppressor genes in MPM-NF2 (Neurofibromatosis type 2) and the recently identified BAP1 (BRCA associated protein 1). […] In addition, germline mutations in BAP1 have been identified that define a new familial cancer syndrome, which includes MPM, ocular melanoma, and other cancers.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/alternative reading frame (CDKN2A/ARF), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) genes are the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes detected in MM cells; the alterations of the latter two are relatively characteristic of MM. […] BAP1 is involved in histone modification and its inactivation induces the disturbance of global gene expression profiling. […] The discovery of a new familial cancer syndrome with germline mutation of BAP1 also indicates the importance of genetic factors in MM susceptibility.
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

By combining whole-exome sequencing and tumor profiling in a family prone to cases of RCC, we identified a germline BAP1 mutation c.277A&amp;gt;G (p.Thr93Ala) as the probable genetic basis of RCC predisposition. […] Furthermore, BAP1 was found to be inactivated in RCC-affected individuals from this family. […] No BAP1 mutations were identified in 32 familial cases presenting with only RCC. […] We then screened for germline BAP1 deleterious mutations in familial aggregations of cancers within the spectrum of the recently described BAP1-associated tumor predisposition syndrome, including uveal melanoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, and cutaneous melanoma. […] Among the 11 families that included individuals identified as carrying germline deleterious BAP1 mutations, 6 families presented with 9 RCC-affected individuals, demonstrating a significantly increased risk for RCC. […] This strongly argues that RCC belongs to the BAP1 syndrome and that BAP1 is a RCC-predisposition gene.
&lt;/td&gt;

Germ-line mutations of BAP1 (BRCA associated protein 1) can predispose to MM, uveal melanoma, and potentially other cancers.

We describe a new family with a novel germline BAP1 nonsense mutation, c.723T&amp;gt;G, which leads to a predicted truncated protein, p.Y241*, or nonsense-mediated decay of the BAP1 mRNA. […] The findings in this family provide further support for the existence of a BAP1 cancer syndrome that predisposes to MM, various melanocytic neoplasms, and potentially other cancers. […] The fact that several members of the family manifested two or more different types of cancer suggests widespread BAP1-related tumor susceptibility targeting tissues of multiple organs. […] In addition, a review of BAP1 cancer syndrome families reported to date indicates that the location of the BAP1 mutation does not have any bearing on the spectrum of cancer types observed, either for mesothelial or melanocytic tumors.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently lost in MPM. […] Germline mutations of BAP1 predispose to several different tumors including malignant mesothelioma. […] Our study aimed to clarify if asbestos exposure has an influence on BAP1 expression and if BAP1 expression could be used as a prognostic factor of outcome. […] An immunohistochemical staining for BAP1 was performed on 123 MPM tissue samples and the expression levels have been correlated with asbestos exposure and overall survival time. […] BAP1 expression was not associated with asbestos exposure but we detected a significant effect of BAP1 expression on overall survival time–the higher the BAP1 expression (non-mutated BAP1), the shorter the overall survival. […] BAP1 mutation has been linked to non-asbestos induced familial mesotheliomas, which usually belong to the long survivor group and BAP1 is most probably functioning differently than in sporadic cases. […] Further investigations need to be performed to characterize the BAP1 mutations and to identify the BAP1 downstream targets in MPM.
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:center;&#34;&gt;
Genomic studies of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have recently identified frequent mutations in the BRCA-associated protein 1(BAP1) gene. […] In uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, BAP1 mutations are associated with poor outcomes but their clinical significance in MPM is unknown. […] We therefore undertook this study to define the characteristics of patients whose MPM tumors harbor somatic BAP1 mutation and to examine the relationship between BAP1 mutation and survival. […] We reviewed the charts of 121 patients with MPM tumors diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 tested for BAP1 mutation, and extracted the following information: age at diagnosis, sex, histology, stage, smoking status, asbestos exposure, family or personal history of malignancy, and treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation as well as survival status. […] Twenty-four of the 121 tumors (20%) harbored somatic BAP1 mutations. […] The percentage of current or former smokers among cases with BAP1 mutations was significantly higher than in BAP1 wild-type cases, (75% versus 42%; p = 0.006). […] However, the types of nucleotide substitutions in BAP1 did not suggest that this association was because of a causative role of smoking in BAP1 mutations. […] No other clinical feature was significantly different among those with and without BAP1 mutations in their MPM. […] There was also no difference in survival according to somatic BAP1 mutation status. […] There is no apparent distinct clinical phenotype for MPM with somatic BAP1 mutation. […] The significance of the more frequent history of smoking among patients with BAP1-mutated MPM warrants further study.
&lt;/td&gt;

Pleural carcinogenesis is better understood with the recent discovery of BAP1 susceptibility gene although no oncogenic driver has been ever uncovered for targeted therapies, although several more or less targeted biological therapies are currently tested in early phase or more advanced-phase trials.

BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) mutations cause a new cancer syndrome, with a high rate of malignant mesothelioma (MM). […] Here, we tested the hypothesis that MM associated with germline BAP1 mutations has a better prognosis compared with sporadic MM. […] We compared survival among germline BAP1 mutation MM patients with that of all MM (N = 10 556) recorded in the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1973 to 2010. […] We identified 23 MM patients–11 alive–with germline BAP1 mutations and available data on survival. […] Actuarial median survival for the MM patients with germline BAP1 mutations was 5 years, as compared with &amp;lt;1 year for the median survival in the United States SEER MM group. […] Analysis of the pooled cohort of germline BAP1 mutation MM showed that patients with peritoneal MM (median survival of 10 years, P = 0.0571), or with a second malignancy in addition to MM (median survival of 10 years, P = 0.0716), survived for a longer time compared with patients who only had pleural MM, or MM patients without a second malignancy, respectively. […] In conclusion, we found that MM patients with germline BAP1 mutations have an overall 7-fold increased long-term survival, independently of sex and age. […] Appropriate genetic counseling and clinical management should be considered for MM patients who are also BAP1 mutation carriers.
&lt;/td&gt;

23% of mesothelioma tumor specimens have a mutation in the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene and germline BAP1 mutations predispose to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Our aim was to investigate germline BAP1 mutations in sporadic MPM patients. […] Exonic DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes of 78 MPM patients was screened for germline BAP1 mutation. […] Taking into account previous similar screenings, the prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations in sporadic MPM patients can be estimated around 1-2%, suggesting a minor role of germline BAP1 mutation in the pathogenesis of sporadic MPM.

Immunohistochemistry staining for BAP1 and NF2 proteins was also performed. […] The commonest genetic variations were clustered in two main pathways: the p53/DNA repair (TP53, SMACB1, and BAP1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathways (PDGFRA, KIT, KDR, HRAS, PIK3CA, STK11, and NF2). […] BAP1 genetic variations identified were mainly located in exons 13 and 17, and BAP1 nonsynonymous variations were significantly correlated with BAP1 protein nuclear localization.

Breast cancer 1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a nuclear deubiquitinase that regulates gene expression, transcription, DNA repair, and more. […] Several findings underscore the apparent driver role of BAP1 in malignant mesothelioma (MM). […] However, the reported frequency of somatic BAP1 mutations in MM varies considerably, a discrepancy that appeared related to either methodological or ethnical differences across various studies. […] To address this discrepancy, we carried out comprehensive genomic and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses to detect somatic BAP1 gene alterations in 22 frozen MM biopsies from U.S. […] By combining Sanger sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, copy number analysis, and cDNA sequencing, we found alteration of BAP1 in 14 of 22 biopsies (63.6%). […] IHC revealed normal nuclear BAP1 staining in the eight MM containing wild-type BAP1, whereas no nuclear staining was detected in the 14 MM biopsies containing tumor cells with mutated BAP1. […] IHC revealed loss of BAP1 nuclear staining in 47 of these 70 MM biopsies (67.1%). […] Our findings conclusively establish BAP1 as the most commonly mutated gene in MM, regardless of ethnic background or other clinical characteristics. […] Our data point to IHC as the most accessible and reliable technique to detect BAP1 status in MM biopsies.

BAP1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is lost or deleted in diverse cancers, including uveal mela¬noma, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), clear cell renal carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. […] Recently, BAP1 germline mutations have been reported in families with combinations of these same cancers. […] A particular challenge for mutation screening is the classification of non-truncating BAP1 sequence variants because it is not known whether these subtle changes can affect the protein function sufficiently to predispose to cancer development. […] Here we report mRNA splicing analysis on a homozygous substitution mutation, BAP1 c. […] The BAP1 c. […] These data support the conclusion that BAP1 c.2054 A&amp;amp;T (p.E685V) variant is a pathogenic mutation and contributes to MPM through disruption of normal splicing.

Previously, pleural MMs have been genetically characterized by the loss of BAP1 (40-60%) as well as loss of NF2 (75%) and CDKN2A (60%). […] Chromosome band 3p21 encoding BAP1 is the most recurrently deleted region (5/9), while, in contrast to pleural MM, NF2 and CDKN2A are not affected. […] BAP1 was the only recurrently mutated gene (N = 3/7). […] In one additional case, loss of the entire chromosome 3 leaves a non-functional copy of BAP1 carrying a rare nonsense germline variant, thus suggesting a potential genetic predisposition in this patient. […] Finally, with targeted sequencing of BAP1 in 3 additional cases, we conclude that BAP1 is frequently altered through copy number losses (N = 3/12), mutations (N = 3/12) or both (N = 2/12) sometimes at a sub-clonal level. […] Our findings suggest a major role for BAP1 in peritoneal MM susceptibility and oncogenesis and indicate important molecular differences to pleural MM as well as potential strategies for therapy and prevention.

Mutations of BAP1 and CDKN2A were each detected in four tumors. […] BAP1 mutation was associated with the lack of expression of BAP1 protein. […] Three cell cultures, all of which were derived from BAP1 mutant primary tumors, exhibited anchorage independent growth and also formed tumors in mice, suggesting that BAP1 loss may enhance tumor growth in vivo. […] Both early passage cell cultures and mouse xenograft tumors harbored BAP1 mutations and CDKN2A deletions identical to those found in the corresponding primary patient tumors. […] The mesothelioma patient derived tumor xenografts with mutational alterations that mimic those observed in patient tumors which we established can be used for preclinical development of novel drug regimens and for studying the functional aspects of BAP1 biology in mesothelioma.

Through an unbiased siRNA screen we found that BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) regulates their expression, with HDAC2 reduced and HDAC1 increased in BAP1 depleted cells. […] BAP1 loss-of-function is increasingly reported in cancers including thoracic malignancies, with frequent mutation in malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Endogenous HDAC2 directly correlates with BAP1 across a panel of lung cancer cell lines, and is downregulated in mesothelioma cell lines with genetic BAP1 inactivation. […] We find that BAP1 regulates HDAC2 by increasing transcript abundance, rather than opposing its ubiquitylation. […] Importantly, although total cellular HDAC activity is unaffected by transient depletion of HDAC2 or of BAP1 due to HDAC1 compensation, this isoenzyme imbalance sensitizes MSTO-211H cells to HDAC inhibitors. […] Our work establishes a mechanism by which BAP1 loss alters sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors. […] Assessment of BAP1 and HDAC expression may ultimately help identify patients likely to respond to HDAC inhibitors.

Recently, variants of the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene resulting in nuclear protein loss were reported in hereditary and sporadic mesothelioma. […] Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the utility of BAP1 expression in the differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and other mesothelial proliferations on a large series of biopsies that included 212 mesotheliomas, 12 benign mesothelial tumors, and 42 reactive mesothelial proliferations. […] BAP1 stain was also performed in 70 cytological samples (45 mesotheliomas and 25 reactive mesothelial proliferations). […] BAP1 was expressed in all benign mesothelial tumors, whereas 139/212 (66%) mesotheliomas were BAP1 negative, especially in epithelioid/biphasic compared with sarcomatoid/desmoplastic subtypes (69% vs 15%). […] BAP1 loss was homogeneous in neoplastic cells except for two epithelioid mesotheliomas showing tumor heterogeneity. […] By fluorescence in situ hybridization, BAP1 protein loss was paralleled by homozygous deletion of the BAP1 locus in the vast majority of BAP1-negative tumors (31/41, 76%), whereas 9/10 BAP1-positive mesotheliomas were normal. […] In biopsies interpreted as reactive mesothelial proliferation BAP1 loss was 100% predictive of malignancy, as all 6 cases subsequently developed BAP1-negative mesothelioma, whereas only 3/36 (8%) BAP1-positive cases progressed to mesothelioma. […] On cytology/cell blocks, benign mesothelial cells were invariably positive for BAP1, whereas 64% of mesotheliomas showed loss of protein; all 6 cases showing BAP1 negativity were associated with histological diagnosis of BAP1-negative mesothelioma. […] BAP1 stain also showed utility in the differential of mesothelioma from most common pleural and peritoneal mimickers, such as lung and ovary carcinomas, with specificity and sensitivity of 99/70% and 100/70%, respectively. […] Our results show that BAP1 protein is frequently lost in mesothelioma, especially of epithelioid/biphasic subtype and is commonly associated with homozygous BAP1 deletion. […] BAP1 immunostain represents an excellent biomarker with an unprecedented specificity (100%) in the distinction between benign and malignant mesothelial proliferations. […] Finding BAP1 loss in mesothelial cells should prompt to immediately reevaluate the patient; moreover, it might be useful in mapping tumor extent and planning surgical resection.

BRCA-1-associated protein (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene, which shows biallelic inactivation in approximately half of all mesotheliomas. […] We investigated whether loss of BAP1 expression by immunohistochemistry can be used to support a diagnosis of mesothelioma in effusion cytology. […] Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed on cell blocks and interpreted blinded. 43 of 75 (57%) effusions associated with confirmed mesothelioma showed negative staining with positive internal controls. […] Of 57 effusions considered to have atypical mesothelial cells in the absence of a definitive diagnosis of mesothelioma, 8 cases demonstrated negative staining for BAP1. […] Only 5 of 100 consecutive benign effusions were interpreted as BAP1 negative. […] On unblinded review the four other patients with apparently negative BAP1 staining but no malignancy lacked convincing positive staining in non-neoplastic cells suggesting that BAP1 immunohistochemistry may have initially been misinterpreted. 47 effusions with adenocarcinoma were BAP1 positive. […] We conclude that loss of BAP1 expression, while not definitive, can be used to support the diagnosis of mesothelioma in effusion cytology. […] We caution that interpretation of BAP1 immunohistochemistry on cell block may be difficult and that convincing positive staining in non-neoplastic cells is required before atypical cells are considered negative. […] We also note that BAP1 loss is not a sensitive test as it occurs in only half of all mesotheliomas and cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis.

Somatic mutations of BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) gene were recently found in MM as well as in uveal melanoma and kidney cancer among the Caucasian and Japanese people. […] However, frequency of mutations varies among the reported studies, which might be due to presence of undetected gross rearrangements of BAP1 gene that might escape detection by sequencing strategy. […] We investigated the presence and frequency of gross genomic rearrangements in the BAP1 gene by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in 17 Japanese cases of MM tumors. […] We found five tumors with partial deletion of BAP1 gene; each tumors displayed partial deletion of exons 1-4 (MM39), exons 1-5 (MM48), exons 11-17 (MM57), exons 1-15 (MM19) and exons 1-16 (MM21). […] Two tumors (MM34, MM14) had biallelic deletion and four tumors (MM29, MM35, MM45 and MM56) had monoallelic deletion of entire BAP1 gene. […] Therefore, MLPA analysis revealed large gene rearrangements of BAP1 gene in 65% of MM (11/17). […] Unusually high frequency of large deletions indicates that the 3p21 chromosomal region surrounding BAP1 gene is structurally unstable. […] MLPA was useful in characterizing both monoallelic and biallelic deletion of BAP1 gene precisely at exon level.

[…] Literature review with emphasis on p16 FISH and BAP1 immunohistochemistry. […] Homozygous deletion of p16 by FISH or loss of BAP1 has only been reported in malignant mesotheliomas and not in benign mesothelial proliferations. […] BAP1 appears to be lost more frequently in epithelial than mixed or sarcomatous mesotheliomas. […] The major drawback to both these tests is limited sensitivity; moreover, failure to find p16 deletion or BAP1 loss does not make a mesothelial process benign. […] In the context of a mesothelial proliferation, the finding of homozygous deletion of p16 by FISH or loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry is, thus far, 100% specific for malignant mesothelioma.

BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) has emerged as a promising biomarker for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Loss of BAP1 expression can occur by a variety of mechanisms, but reports on incidence are variable and the clinical significance is unclear. […] In order to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of BAP1, we constructed a tissue microarray consisting of 111 MPM cases and performed BAP1 immunohistochemistry. […] BAP1 was lost in 77% of epithelioid cases (n=58) but was retained in all sarcomatoid cases (n=10); 49% of biphasic cases showed loss (n=43), and BAP1-negative cases demonstrated loss of staining in both the epithelioid and sarcomatoid components. […] All non-neoplastic mesothelial tissues (n=20) retained BAP1, resulting in a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 61%, 100%, 100%, and 32%, respectively. […] Moreover, BAP1 expression in spindled mesothelium enabled discrimination of reactive and malignant cells, thus providing a more objective means of distinguishing epithelioid from biphasic morphology compared to histology alone. […] Nonetheless, BAP1 staining was patchy in some benign mesothelial neoplasms, which raises concern for using BAP1 in small biopsies. […] Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival with BAP1 loss, but this did not reach significance in multivariate analysis accounting for histologic subtype. […] We conclude that BAP1 loss is frequent in epithelioid MPM, which is in turn associated with improved survival, and that it can have additional clinical significance by facilitating histologic classification.

BAP1 immunohistochemistry and p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have recently been reported as reliable markers of malignancy in biopsies of mesothelioma. […] Four cytology specimens were too scanty for p16 FISH analysis but were interpretable for BAP1 immunohistochemistry. […] Overall, loss of BAP1 and/or deletion of p16 was seen in 11/11 (100%) of matched cytology and tissue biopsy specimens. […] BAP1 loss alone was seen in 10/15 (67%) biopsies and 10/15 (67%) cytology specimens. […] All mesothelioma biopsy/cytology pairs showed exactly the same pattern of BAP1 or p16 retention or loss in the biopsy and cytology specimens.

Heritable mutations in the BAP1 tumor suppressor gene predispose individuals to mesothelioma and other cancers. […] However, a large-scale assessment of germline BAP1 mutation incidence and associated clinical features in mesothelioma patients with a family history of cancer has not been reported. […] Therefore, we examined the germline BAP1 mutation status of 150 mesothelioma patients with a family history of cancer, 50 asbestos-exposed control individuals with a family history of cancers other than mesothelioma, and 153 asbestos-exposed individuals without familial cancer. […] No BAP1 alterations were found in control cohorts, but were identified in nine of 150 mesothelioma cases (6%) with a family history of cancer. […] Alterations among these cases were characterized by both missense and frameshift mutations, and enzymatic activity of BAP1 missense mutants was decreased compared with wild-type BAP1. […] Furthermore, BAP1 mutation carriers developed mesothelioma at an earlier age that was more often peritoneal than pleural (five of nine) and exhibited improved long-term survival compared to mesothelioma patients without BAP1 mutations. […] Moreover, many tumors harboring BAP1 germline mutations were associated with BAP1 syndrome, including mesothelioma and ocular/cutaneous melanomas, as well as renal, breast, lung, gastric, and basal cell carcinomas. […] Collectively, these findings suggest that mesothelioma patients presenting with a family history of cancer should be considered for BAP1 genetic testing to identify those individuals who might benefit from further screening and routine monitoring for the purpose of early detection and intervention.

[…] We conclude that: (1) BAP1 immunohistochemistry is relatively insensitive in the context of sarcomatous and desmoplastic mesotheliomas, but as a matter of time and cost efficiency may nonetheless be a useful first approach to the problem; (2) deletion of p16 by FISH is considerably more sensitive, but there remain a proportion of cases in which p16 is not deleted; (3) a small improvement in sensitivity can be achieved by using both markers; (4) in the context of a spindle cell malignant tumor in the pleura or peritoneum, which morphologically might be a metastatic sarcomatoid carcinoma or a mesothelioma, the finding of BAP1 loss favors mesothelioma, but p16 FISH cannot be used to separate sarcomatous mesotheliomas from sarcomatoid carcinomas.

The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is involved in several cancers, including MMD. […] Loss of BAP1 expression is correlated with BAP1 somatic or constitutional genetic defects. […] Our work assesses the value of integrating BAP1 in the panel of antibodies used for the diagnosis of MMD. […] Of the 26 patients with MMD and the 24 patients with adenocarcinoma pleural metastasis, loss of BAP1 expression was observed in 11 (48%) and one adenocarcinoma (6%) on cytological specimens and in 12 MMD (48%) and in one adenocarcinoma (5%) on biopsy specimens. […] The specificity of BAP1 was 100% on cytological and biopsy specimen for the diagnosis of malignancy in case of mesothelial proliferation. […] Loss of BAP1 expression is an indicator of MMD in a context of mesothelial proliferation. […] Furthermore, loss of BAP1 expression guides the patient to an oncology genetic counseling in order to eliminate a MMD developed as part of a constitutional genetic defect.

Loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CDKN2A(p16) deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been proposed to distinguish malignant mesothelioma (MM) from atypical reactive mesothelial proliferations (ARMP) in effusions but it is uncertain whether both tests are needed routinely. […] Paraffin embedded blocks from 67 effusions (32 MM, 35 ARMP) were evaluated with BAP1 IHC. 38 of them (17 MM, 21 ARMP) were also analyzed with CDKN2A (p16) FISH. […] Criteria for MM were absence of BAP1 nuclear staining in &amp;gt;50% of atypical mesothelial cells in the presence of a positive internal control, and/or CDKN2A(p16) homozygous or hemizygous deletion pattern in &amp;gt;15% or &amp;gt;41.5% of atypical mesothelial cells, respectively. […] BAP1 IHC and CDKN2A(p16) FISH yield similar sensitivities for MM in paired samples but FISH has a higher specificity. […] However, BAP1 IHC alone may be sufficient to diagnose MM when clinical, imaging, and cytological findings strongly suggest MM.

Recent data identified BRCA1-associated protein 1 gene (BAP1) as one of the most frequently mutated genes in MPM. […] Immunohistochemical testing for BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) has been proposed to be predictive for the detection of BAP1 mutation in neoplastic cells. […] The aim of the present study was to define the diagnostic usefulness of immunohistochemical determination of BAP1 in MPM, with clinicopathological correlation. […] A series of 143 MPMs were investigated for BAP1 protein expression in correlation with clinical and pathological data, including with a newly proposed nuclear grade. […] A pilot series of 20 selected cases were also investigated for BAP1 mutational status. […] Negative nuclear staining for BAP1 occurred in 62% of MPMs (including 27% with a cytoplasmic pattern) and was significantly associated with the presence of BAP1 mutation, epithelioid subtype, and a better prognosis. […] In a subgroup of cases, the pattern of expression of BAP1 in stromal cells supported their distinction as reactive versus neoplastic, thus helping achieve the correct classification of biphasic histological subtype. […] We showed that BAP1 protein determination is a diagnostic tool to correctly distinguish biphasic MPM from epithelial subtypes with an atypical/activated reactive stroma and an independent prognostic parameter in MPM.

However, in about 10-20% of the cases, the IHC results can be confusing and inconclusive, and novel markers are sought to increase the diagnostic accuracy.We stained 45 non-small cell lung cancer samples (32 adenocarcinomas and 13 squamous cell carcinomas) with a monoclonal antibody for BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) and also with an IHC panel we routinely use to help differentiate MM from carcinomas, which include, calretinin, Wilms Tumor 1, cytokeratin 5, podoplanin D2-40, pankeratin CAM5.2, thyroid transcription factor 1, Napsin-A, and p63. […] Nuclear BAP1 expression was also analyzed in 35 MM biopsies. […] All 45 non-small cell lung cancer biopsies stained positive for nuclear BAP1, whereas 22/35 (63%) MM biopsies lacked nuclear BAP1 staining, consistent with previous data. […] Lack of BAP1 nuclear staining was associated with MM (two-tailed Fisher’s Exact Test, P = 5.4 x 10-11). […] Focal BAP1 staining was observed in a subset of samples, suggesting polyclonality. […] Our study indicated that absence of nuclear BAP1 stain helps differentiate MM from lung carcinomas. […] We suggest that BAP1 staining should be added to the IHC panel that is currently used to distinguish these malignancies.

Loss of nuclear staining of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1; detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC)) and homozygous deletion (HD) of p16 (detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) are useful for differentiation of MPM from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia (RMH), but the correlation between BAP1 expression loss and p16 HD has not been fully described. […] We performed BAP1 IHC and p16-specific FISH for 40 MPM and 20 RMH cases, and measured proportions of cells showing BAP1 expression and p16 HD for each case. […] BAP1 expression loss, p16 HD and coexistence of both were present in 27 (67.5 %), 27 (67.5 %) and 17 (42.5 %) MPM cases, respectively. […] Three MPM cases (7.5 %) and all 20 RMH cases had neither BAP1 loss nor p16 HD. […] Their combination showed higher sensitivity (92.5 %, 37/40) and estimated probability than BAP1 IHC and p16-specific FISH used alone. […] BAP1 IHC and p16-specific FISH have independent diagnostic value, and have increased reliability when used in combination, for MPM diagnosis.

BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) and CDKN2A (p16) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have shown clinical utility in confirming the diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the role for using these 2 markers to guide clinical management is not yet clear. […] Although p16 loss is predictive of poor prognosis, there is controversy as to whether BAP1 loss is predictive of a more favorable prognosis; how these results interact with one another has not been explored. […] We performed CDKN2A FISH on a previously published tissue microarray on which we had performed BAP1 IHC, revealing combined BAP1/p16 status for 93 MPM cases. […] As expected, BAP1 IHC in combination with CDKN2A FISH resulted in high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (100%) for MPM, and p16 loss was an independent predictor of poor survival (hazard ratio, 2.2553; P = .0135). […] There was no association between BAP1 loss and p16 loss, as 26%, 28%, 30%, and 16% of overall cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 alone, loss of p16 alone, loss of both BAP1 and p16, or neither abnormality, respectively. […] Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that BAP1 IHC is not an independent predictor of prognosis, when viewed in combination with homozygous CDKN2A deletion, risk stratification was evident. […] More specifically, patients with CDKN2A disomy and loss of BAP1 expression had improved outcomes compared with those with CDKN2A disomy and retained BAP1 expression (hazard ratio, 0.2286; P = .0017), and this finding was notably evident among epithelioid cases. […] We conclude that BAP1 IHC provides prognostic information within the context of CDKN2A FISH that may have clinical utility beyond diagnosis.

The most frequent genetic alteration was biallelic inactivation of the BAP1 gene, which occurred in 9/13 cases, with an additional two cases demonstrating monoallelic loss of BAP1. […] All 11 of these cases demonstrated loss of BAP1 nuclear staining by immunohistochemistry, whereas two tumors without BAP1 alteration and all 42 cases of histologic mimics in peritoneum (8 multilocular peritoneal inclusion cyst, 6 well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma of the peritoneum, 16 adenomatoid tumor, and 12 low-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary) demonstrated intact BAP1 nuclear staining. […] While these genes are known to be recurrently mutated in pleural mesotheliomas, the frequencies are distinct in peritoneal mesotheliomas, with nearly 85% of peritoneal tumors harboring BAP1 alterations versus only 20-30% of pleural tumors. […] Together, these findings demonstrate the importance of epigenetic modifiers including BAP1, SETD2, and DDX3X in mesothelial tumorigenesis and suggest opportunities for targeted therapies.

BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in regulation of the cell cycle, cellular differentiation, repair of DNA damage, and apoptosis. […] In the distinction of malignant mesothelioma from benign mesothelial proliferations, immunohistochemical loss of BAP1, the protein expressed by the BAP1 gene, has proven highly specific for malignant mesothelioma. […] However, few studies have investigated the rate of BAP1 loss in tumors that commonly metastasize to the pleura. […] Our objective is to determine the rate of BAP1 loss in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). […] Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed using tissue microarrays containing 133 confirmed cases of NSCLC (80 of lung adenocarcinoma and 53 of squamous cell carcinoma). […] Cases were interpreted as showing BAP1 loss if nuclear staining was completely absent in all tumor cells and present in stromal and inflammatory cells that served as internal controls. […] Cases showing no BAP1 staining in the internal controls were excluded. […] After exclusion of 32 cases for technical reasons, only 1 case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma of 101 cases of NSCLC (69 adenocarcinoma and 32 squamous cell carcinoma; 1.0% of cases) showed BAP1 loss. […] We conclude that loss of BAP1 expression is a rare event in NSCLC. […] Therefore, BAP1 is a potentially useful addition to the immunohistochemical markers used to distinguish mesothelioma from pleural metastasis of NSCLC.

BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a deubiquitinating hydrolase that plays a key role in various cellular processes. […] Germline and somatic inactivation of BRCA1 associated protein 1 gene (BAP1) is frequent in pleural mesothelioma; however, little is known about its status in peritoneal mesothelioma. […] The status of BAP1 was evaluated at the mutational and protein expression levels and combined with our previous data on copy number alterations assessed in the same samples. […] Overall, 73% of the malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas analyzed carried at least one inactivated BAP1 allele, but only 57% had a complete loss of its protein nuclear expression. […] Better overall survival was observed for patients with BAP1 mutations (p = 0.04), protein expression loss (p = 0.016), or at least one of these alterations (p = 0.007) independently of tumor histological subtype, age, and sex. […] As in pleural mesothelioma, inactivation of BAP1 is frequent in peritoneal mesotheliomas.

[…] We examined the expression of the 9p21.3-related proteins (p14, p15, p16, and methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)) and BAP1 using IHC in 51 MPM and 25 RMH cases, and assessed their correlation with HD of p16 detected by FISH. […] The diagnostic usefulness of IHC of the 9p21.3-related proteins and BAP1 and their combinations was assessed using the cut-off values set by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. […] For differentiating MPM from RMH, only MTAP showed 100% specificity among the 9p21.3-related proteins, as did BAP1 IHC and 9p21 FISH. […] Among BAP1 combinations, only that of BAP1 with MTAP showed 100% specificity. […] Its sensitivity was 76.5%, which was lower than BAP1 IHC and 9p21 FISH combination (84.3%), but higher than BAP1 IHC alone (60.8%) or 9p21 FISH alone (60.8%). […] A combination of MTAP or BAP1 loss detected by IHC can likely detect MPM with good sensitivity and 100% specificity, and serve as useful ancillary IHC for discriminating MPM from RMH.

BRCA1 associated protein1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification by deubiquitinating histone 2A, and DNA repair. […] BAP1 mutations are frequent in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Our aim was to functionally characterize a newly identified isoform of BAP1 and investigate the effects of its expression on drug sensitivity in MPM. […] Expression of BAP1 isoforms was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in MPM and normal mesothelium cell lines and tumor and nontumor samples. […] Subcellular localization of BAP1 isoforms was examined by immunofluorescence. […] We have identified a novel alternative splice isoform of BAP1 (BAP1Δ) that misses part of the catalytic domain. […] Cells transfected with BAP1Δ showed reduced deubiquitinating activity compared with full-length BAP1. […] The expression of BAP1Δ transcript is more abundant in nontumor than in tumor samples. […] MPM cell lines expressing more than 20% of BAP1Δ are more sensitive to olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) cytotoxicity, and this sensitivity is enhanced when olaparib treatment is combined with GDC0980 (a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor), which induces downregulation of BRCA1. […] These observations suggest that BAP1Δ does regulate DNA damage response and influences drug sensitivity. […] It might therefore be relevant to investigate whether patients with high expression of BAP1Δ may be responsive to PARP/PI3K-mTOR inhibitors.

We have recently shown that the breast cancer (BRCA)1-associated protein-1 tumor suppressor gene (BAP1) is inactivated in a subset of clinically aggressive meningiomas that display rhabdoid histomorphology. […] Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 protein provides a rapid and inexpensive method for screening suspected cases. […] Notably, some patients with BAP1-mutant meningiomas have germline BAP1 mutations and BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (TPDS). […] It appears that nearly all patients with germline BAP1 mutations develop malignancies by age 55, most frequently uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma, or renal cell carcinoma, although other cancers have also been associated with BAP1 TPDS. […] Therefore, when confronted with a patient with a potentially high-grade rhabdoid meningioma, it is important that neuropathologists assess the BAP1 status of the tumor and that the patient’s family history of cancer is carefully ascertained. […] In the appropriate clinical setting, genetic counseling and germline BAP1 DNA sequencing should be performed. […] A cancer surveillance program for individuals who carry germline BAP1 mutations may help identify tumors such as uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma at early and treatable stages. […] Because BAP1-mutant meningiomas are rare tumors, multi-institutional efforts will be needed to evaluate therapeutic strategies and to further define the clinicopathologic features of these tumors.

BAP1 is an emerging tumor suppressor whose inactivating mutations have been found to play critical roles in tumor development. […] This study was conducted to elucidate the potential value of BAP1 mutation in guiding prognostic prediction and clinical stratification. […] We conducted a comprehensive analysis of relevant studies from multiple databases, to determine the impact of BAP1 mutation on the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients in various cancers. […] Although the pooled results demonstrated that BAP1 mutation was a negative indicator of overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.73; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-2.42) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.25; 95% confidence interval = 1.47-3.45), this prognostic value was only applicable to uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but not to malignant pleural mesothelioma or cholangiocarcinoma. […] Consistently, BAP1 mutation was correlated with critical clinicopathological features only in uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma. […] In uveal melanoma, BAP1 mutation and SF3B1/EIF1AX mutations were negatively correlated, and BAP1-mutant tumors indicated significant worse prognosis than SF3B1/EIF1AX-mutant tumors ( p = 0.028). […] While in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, BAP1 mutation was mutually exclusive with PBRM1 mutations, and BAP1-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinomas also showed significantly worse prognosis than PBRM1-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinomas ( p = 0.001). […] Our study revealed a unique tissue-specific significance of BAP1 mutation in prognostic prediction among different types of cancer. […] Clinically, combining detection of BAP1 mutation and other driver mutations may further allow for a more precise molecular taxonomy to stratify patients into distinct subgroups in uveal melanoma and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

Between 23 and 64% of malignant pleural mesothelioma have somatic inactivating mutations in the BAP1 gene. […] BAP1 is a homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair component found in the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. […] Similar to BRCA1/2 deficient cancers, mutation in the BAP1 gene leads to a deficient HR pathway and increases the reliance on other DNA repair pathways. […] We hypothesized that BAP1-mutant MPM would require PARP1 for survival, similar to the BRCA1/2 mutant breast and ovarian cancers. […] Surprisingly, we found that all MPM cell lines examined, regardless of BAP1 status, were addicted to PARP1-mediated DNA repair for survival. […] We found that niraparib and olaparib exposure markedly decreased clonal survival in multiple MPM cell lines, with and without BAP1 mutations.

Here, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of BAP1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in distinguishing between reactive and neoplastic mesothelial cells. […] In pleural and peritoneal effusions from 147 patients with diagnosed MM or with a differential diagnosis of MM and MH, the expression of BAP1 was examined by IHC on paraffin-embedded cell blocks (n = 121) and biopsies (n = 44). […] BAP1 IHC was evaluated for nuclear staining as positive or negative on target mesothelial cells, with appropriate internal control. […] In MM cases, loss of BAP1 nuclear staining was observed in 76.5% of the cell blocks and 47.5% of the biopsies. […] All BAP1-negative cases with a differential diagnosis of benign and malignant mesothelial proliferations were MM at follow-up. […] All MH cases, the 29% of epithelial MM and the 90% of nonepithelial MM, retained BAP1 expression. […] Synchronous and methacronous biopsy/cytology pairs showed matching BAP1 results. […] In effusions with mesotheliomatous cells or atypical mesothelial cells of uncertain significance, negative BAP1 IHC strongly supports a diagnosis of MM. […] With prudence in interpreting immunostaining, BAP1 may be included in IHC panels for MM cytodiagnosis, given its high specificity and sensitivity.

BAP1 loss, increasingly used in the differential diagnosis of benign versus malignant mesothelial proliferation, occured in 55% (99 of 181) of peritoneal mesothelioma cases. - The results support the experience that there is no definitive marker to rule out malignant mesothelioma, including PAX8, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p63 immunoreactivity.

&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; To investigate the expression of BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) in malignant mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer and carcinosarcoma, and its application in the differential diagnosis. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Twenty-two cases of malignant mesothelioma including 17 epithelioid type, 2 sarcomatoid type and 3 biphasic type were collected.As the study control, 80 non-small cell lung cancers infringement pleural membrane(including 40 lung adenocarcinomas and 40 lung squamous cell carcinomas) and 15 carcinosarcomas were included. […] BAP1 expression was detected using immunohistochemical method. […] A differential diagnosis antibody panel, including calretinin, WT1, CK5/6, D2-40, CAM5.2, CEA, TTF1, Napsin A, p63 and p40 was tested in all cases. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; All 80 cases of non-small cell lung cancer and 15 cases of carcinosarcoma were BAP1 positive. […] In contrast, 64% (14/22) of malignant mesotheliomas lost BAP1 expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). […] Addition of BAP1 to the mesothelioma marker panel, the diagnostic accuracy of malignant mesothelioma was enhanced to 93%. […] Focal expression of BAP1 in tumors suggested multiclonal evolution of mesothelioma. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Loss of BAP1 expression helps to confirm the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma whereas all non-small cell lung cancer expresses BAP1. […] It is therefore recommended that BAP1 can be used in conjunction with other immunohistochemical markers to improve the diagnostic accuracy of malignant mesothelioma. &lt;b&gt;目的：&lt;/b&gt; 探讨BRCA相关蛋白1(BRCA associated protein 1，BAP1)在恶性间皮瘤、肺腺癌、肺鳞癌和癌肉瘤中表达情况及其在鉴别诊断中的作用。 […] 应用免疫组织化学方法检测BAP1在各组病例的表达情况，并分析各组表达差异。 […] &lt;b&gt;结果：&lt;/b&gt; 所有80例非小细胞肺癌和15例癌肉瘤均BAP1核表达阳性，而64%(14/22)恶性间皮瘤出现BAP1表达缺失，两者差异有统计学意义(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01)。 […] 间皮瘤诊断标志物组合中，增加BAP1后，诊断恶性间皮瘤的诊断正确度达93%。 […] BAP1灶性表达表明肿瘤细胞具有多克隆性。 […] &lt;b&gt;结论：&lt;/b&gt; BAP1核表达缺失有助于鉴别恶性间皮瘤和非小细胞肺癌。 […] 因此推荐BAP1与其他间皮瘤抗体一起应用于恶性间皮瘤的诊断，提高恶性间皮瘤的诊断准确性。.

Homozygous deletion of 9p21 detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and loss of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) are useful for the differentiation between malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. […] In the current study, the authors investigated whether a combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC could distinguish MPM from reactive mesothelial cells (RMC) in cell blocks obtained from pleural effusions. […] The authors examined IHC expression of MTAP and BAP1 in cell blocks obtained from pleural effusions of 45 cases of MPM and 21 cases of reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. […] MTAP and BAP1 IHC differentiated MPM from RMC with 100% specificity for both and sensitivities of 42.2% and 60.0%, respectively. […] The combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC yielded a sensitivity of 77.8%, which was higher than that of BAP1 IHC alone or 9p21 FISH alone (62.2%). […] A combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC in cell blocks from pleural effusions appears to be a reliable and useful method for differentiating MPM cells from RMC and can be used in the routine diagnosis of MPM.

Recently, loss of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression and/or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A were identified in some MM, but not in reactive mesothelial proliferations. […] We studied 34 cases of atypical mesothelial proliferation from our institutional files (1993 to 2016) for BAP1 expression, deletion of CDKN2A, and clinical outcome. […] BAP1 expression was lost in 6 of these 15 (40%) patients. […] BAP1 expression was also lost in 1 case of probable MM.

BAP1 is a tumour suppressor gene commonly mutated in MM. […] Germline BAP1 mutation has been associated with early onset and less aggressive disease compared with sporadic MM. […] Sporadic BAP1 mutations are common and are associated with improved survival in MM, contrary to other malignancies. […] This study investigated the prognostic role of BAP1 in matched cytology and surgical specimens and aimed to investigate the association between BAP1 and the established prognostic marker VEGFA from a cohort of 81 patients. […] BAP1 mutation was found in 58% of histology and 59% of cytology specimens. […] Loss of BAP1 expression in both surgical and cytology specimens was significantly associated with poorer survival in a multivariate analysis when controlling for known prognostic indicators. […] We conclude that the prognostic significance of BAP1 mutations in MM cannot be determined in isolation of other prognostic factors, which may vary between patients. […] Pathologists should employ caution when commenting on prognostic implications of BAP1 status of MM patients in diagnostic pathology reports, but it may be useful for early diagnosis.

[…] The correlation between BAP1 expression and patient survival was evaluated for 10 different cancer types.

[…] BAP1 expression was a favorable predicative factor for OS in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47-0.69), non-small cell lung cancer (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.96), and uveal melanoma (HR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.62), while high expression of BAP1 was associated with poorer outcome in malignant pleural mesothelioma (HR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.67-2.47).

[…] Effusions (n = 258), consisting of 53 malignant mesotheliomas and 205 other cancers, the majority carcinomas (62 breast, 60 ovarian, 31 lung, 51 carcinomas of other origin, 1 melanoma), were analyzed for BAP1 expression using immunohistochemistry. […] BAP1 was lost in 46 (87%) mesotheliomas compared with 4 (2%) of 205 other cancers (P &amp;lt; .001), resulting in sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 98%, respectively. […] The 4 carcinomas with loss of BAP1 included 1 ovarian, 1 breast, 1 uterine cervical, and 1 gastric carcinoma. […] The present study supports the role of BAP1 as a highly sensitive and specific marker for malignant mesothelioma in serous effusions and argues for inclusion of this test in all specimens in which this diagnosis is considered.

A missense mutation in &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; was revealed in both samples, with coverage data indicating a germline event.

[…] With the knowledge of an underlying &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; mutation and its known frequent association with epithelioid mesothelioma, the histology was reassessed and the diagnosis was revised to epithelioid mesothelioma. […] Additionally, this case highlights typical features of &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; TPDS with its general susceptibility to cancers, with pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas as most prevalent clinical entities and the typically more benign course of these epithelioid mesotheliomas compared with &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;-unrelated cases of mesotheliomas.

The most frequently altered genes in human MM are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), which encodes components of the p53 (p14ARF) and RB (p16INK4A) pathways, BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1), and neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2).

Several immunohistochemical stains whose expressions have possible therapeutic implications have been identified in MPM such as BAP1, mesothelin and PD-L1. […] The aim of our work was to evaluate the clinical significance and prognostic implications of BAP1, mesothelin and PD-L1 expression in 117 patients with a diagnosis of MPM who were diagnosed in our institution between 2002 and 2017. […] Mesothelin expression, BAP1 loss and PD-L1 expression were associated with histopathological subtype (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), BAP1 loss was more frequent in epithelioid subtype whereas PD-L1 expression was more frequent in non-epithelioid subtype. […] For epithelioid MPM, BAP1 expression was associated with overall survival (p = 0.034), with a longer survival when BAP1 expression is lost. […] For non-epithelioid MPM, overall survival was not related to clinical, histopathological or immunohistochemical expression of BAP1, mesothelin or PD-L1. […] In epithelioid and non-epithelioid MPM, we analysed overall survival in subgroups with combined mesothelin, BAP1 and PD-L1 expression. […] In epithelioid MPM, BAP1 retained/mesothelin negativity/PD-L1 &amp;gt; 1%, and BAP1 retained/mesothelin positivity/PD-L1 &amp;gt; 1% profiles, are associated with shorter overall survival. […] In non-epithelioid MPM, BAP1 loss/mesothelin negativity/PD-L1 &amp;gt; 1% is associated with shorter overall survival.

Sequential use of BAP1 immunohistochemistry and CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization is specific for diagnosis of mesothelioma, but fluorescence in situ hybridization is both costly and time-consuming. […] We studied 49 cases of mesothelioma (17 epithelioid mesothelioma, 22 biphasic mesothelioma, and 10 sarcomatoid mesothelioma) and 23 benign mesothelial proliferations using a 5-hmC single immunohistochemical stain, CAM5.2/5-hmC double immunohistochemical stain, and BAP1 immunohistochemistry. […] An immunopanel including 5-hmC and BAP1 immunohistochemistry achieved sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 100%. […] In challenging mesothelial lesions, immunohistochemical studies showing either extensive 5-hmC loss or BAP1 loss indicate a diagnosis of mesothelioma, precluding the need for CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization in a considerable number of cases.

Pathogenic germline variants in the BAP1 tumor suppressor gene can cause a cancer syndrome called BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), which is characterized by predisposition to mesothelioma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and other tumors. […] Asbestos exposure has often been reported in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and germline variants in BAP1, but this exposure has never been quantified. […] We aimed to search for germline variants in BAP1 among 25 new Italian probands with suspected BAP1-TPDS, summarize the prevalence of these variants in 39 Italian patients with familial MPM and other tumors recruited over a 5-year period, and compare cumulative asbestos exposure in 14 patients with MPM and pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, CDKN2A, or DNA repair genes with that of 67 patients without germline variants in 94 cancer-predisposing genes. […] We report here a new pathogenic germline variant in BAP1: c.783 + 2 T &amp;gt; C. […] The prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in BAP1 was 7.7% among patients with familial MPM (3/39). […] Patients with pathogenic germline variants in BAP1, CDKN2A, or DNA repair genes showed lower cumulative asbestos exposure than patients without germline variants in 94 cancer-predisposing genes (P = .00002).

Loss of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (BAP1 IHC) and homozygous deletion (HD) of 9p21 as detected by fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) (9p21 FISH) are effective for distinguishing malignant mesothelial proliferation from benign proliferation. […] In this study, we investigated whether a combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC could distinguish sarcomatoid MPM from fibrous pleuritis. […] We examined IHC expressions of MTAP and BAP1 and 9p21 FISH in sarcomatoid/desmoplastic (n = 18) and biphasic MPM (n = 12) and in fibrous pleuritis (n = 17). […] MTAP IHC and BAP1 IHC showed 80% and 36.7% sensitivity, respectively, and both showed 100% specificity in differentiating MPM from fibrous pleuritis. […] A combination of MTAP and BAP1 IHC yielded greater sensitivity (90%) than that detected for MTAP IHC alone or BAP1 IHC alone.

The newly appreciated BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) antibody may help distinguish MM from RMC based on its immunohistochemical (IHC) staining pattern but its role in cytopathology is controversial. […] Immunohistochemistry with BAP1 antibody was performed on cell blocks from 39 cytology specimens including 13 cases of RMC and 26 cases of effusion and fine-needle aspiration specimens (FNAC) with tissue-specimen-proven MM. […] Positivity was defined as &amp;gt;50% loss of nuclear BAP1 IHC staining. […] Of the 26 MM cases, a slight majority (14/26, 54%) showed loss of BAP1 nuclear IHC staining, while all 13 RMC controls showed strong nuclear BAP1 IHC staining. […] MM was more likely to show loss of BAP1 than RMC (P &amp;lt; .001); and peritoneal MM was more likely to demonstrate loss of BAP1 than pleural MM (P = .04). […] There was perfect specificity at 1.0 and positive predictive value of 1.0 for loss of nuclear BAP1 IHC staining. […] These data confirm that absence of BAP1 nuclear staining identifies malignant mesothelial cells. […] On the other hand, positive BAP1 nuclear staining can occur in both benign and malignant pleural effusions.

[…] Assessment of the frequency and pattern of BAP1 gene mutations in Egyptian patients with advanced sporadic MPM in relation to disease progression and survival rates in order to identify a novel therapeutic target for MPM. […] BAP1 gene mutations were assessed from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing and these mutations have been confirmed using the tumor tissue.

Recently, loss of BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been suggested as a potential marker for identifying MM, but data is still limited. […] We studied 264 MM cases (257 using tissue microarrays; 7 on conventional slides) and 42 genital ATs for BAP1 immunohistochemical expression. […] Loss of BAP1 protein expression was observed in 119/211 of MM cases (56.4%). […] Taken by histologic type, 64.3% of biphasic, 55.4% of epithelioid, and 41.7% of sarcomatoid MM were BAP1-deficient. […] In contrast, all 42 ATs showed retained BAP1 immunoreactivity. […] Notably, all 4 MM cases with variable adenomatoid-like features were BAP1-deficient. […] Surface components of MM of the pleura showed concordant loss as the invasive tumor suggesting a potential role for BAP1 loss for recognizing so-called early mesothelioma. […] In conclusion, BAP1 loss demonstrated by IHC is seen in more than half of MM cases but none of ATs. […] Thus, BAP1 IHC represents a potential adjunct for distinguishing MM from benign mesothelial proliferations including in particular “MM with bland adenomatoid-like pattern versus benign ATs” on biopsy material and early mesothelioma with limited invasion.

[…] We examined IHC expression of EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP, and 9p21 FISH in MPM (n = 38) and RMH (n = 29) and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of each detection assay for distinguishing MPM from RMH. […] EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP IHC, and 9p21 FISH were characterized by a 100% specificity each and 44.7%, 52.6%, 47.4%, and 65.8% sensitivities, respectively. […] A combination of EZH2 and BAP1 IHC, and 9p21 FISH showed the greatest sensitivity (89.5%). […] Using IHC alone (EZH2, BAP1, and MTAP IHC) also yielded a good sensitivity of 86.9%; this level is high enough for routine diagnostics. […] There were no statistically significant associations between expression of EZH2 and that of other markers (BAP1 and MTAP IHC) or 9p21 HD.

[…] Adenoviral-Cre treatment of normal mesothelial cells from &lt;i&gt;Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a&lt;/i&gt; CKO mice, but not from mice with knockout of one or any two of these genes, resulted in robust spheroid formation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that mesothelial cells from &lt;i&gt;Bap1;Nf2;Cdkn2a&lt;/i&gt; mice have stem cell-like potential. […] RNA-seq analysis of malignant mesotheliomas from triple-CKO mice revealed enrichment of genes transcriptionally regulated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and others previously implicated in known Bap1-related cellular processes. […] These data demonstrate that somatic inactivation of &lt;i&gt;Bap1, Nf2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cdkn2a&lt;/i&gt; results in rapid, aggressive malignant mesotheliomas, and that deletion of &lt;i&gt;Bap1&lt;/i&gt; contributes to tumor development, in part, by loss of PRC2-mediated repression of tumorigenic target genes and by acquisition of stem cell potential, suggesting a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. […] SIGNIFICANCE: Combinatorial deletions of &lt;i&gt;Bap1, Nf2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Cdkn2a&lt;/i&gt; result in aggressive mesotheliomas, with &lt;i&gt;Bap1&lt;/i&gt; loss contributing to tumorigenesis by circumventing PRC2-mediated repression of oncogenic target genes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1), glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and desmin expression by immunohistochemistry in the discrimination between reactive and malignant mesothelial proliferations. […] BAP1 loss was detected in 61/88 (69%) tissues and in 20/30 (67%) cytology samples from mesothelioma with a specificity of 100% for both sampling methods. […] BAP1 loss was observed more frequently in pleural and biphasic tumours. […] Concordance rate of results between biopsy and cytology was as follows: BAP1 20/20 (100%); GLUT-1 13/18 (72%); and desmin 10/14 (71%). […] BAP1, GLUT-1 and desmin are useful markers in the discrimination between reactive and malignant mesothelial proliferations. […] BAP1 loss seems to be diagnostic for mesotheliomas both in biopsy and cytology samples.

Identification of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene mutations in MPM have led to the development of new ancillary tests that can streamline the diagnostic pathway.

[…] In this study, we investigated whether NF2 FISH, either alone or in a combination with other diagnostic assays (9p21 FISH, MTAP immunohistochemistry, and BAP1 immunohistochemistry), is effective for distinguishing malignant pleural mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. […] We used FISH to examine deletion status of NF2 and 9p21 and immunohistochemistry to examine expression of MTAP and BAP1 in malignant pleural mesothelioma and in reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. […] A combination of NF2 FISH, 9p21 FISH, and BAP1 immunohistochemistry yielded greater sensitivity (100%) than that detected for either diagnostic assay alone (53.2% for NF2 FISH, 78.7% for 9p21 FISH, 70.2% for MTAP immunohistochemistry, or 57.4% for BAP1 immunohistochemistry).

Genomic characterization identified several subgroups: (1) BAP1 mutations with deletions of CDKN2A and NF2 in two tumors; (2) TRAF7 mutations in two tumors, including one harboring trisomies of chromosomes 3, 5, 7, and X; and (3) genomic near-haploidization, characterized by extensive loss of heterozygosity sparing chromosomes 5 and 7. […] Localized pleural mesotheliomas appear genetically heterogeneous and include BAP1-mutated, TRAF7-mutated, and near-haploid subgroups.

CCDC6 (coiled-coil domain containing 6) is a player of the HR response to DNA damage and has been predicted to interact with BAP1, another HR-DNA repair gene highly mutated in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. […] The interaction between CCDC6 and BAP1 was confirmed in MPM cells, by co-immunoprecipitation. […] A TMA including 34 MPM cores was immunostained for CCDC6, USP7 and BAP1 and the results correlated by statistical analysis. […] The silencing of CCDC6 when combined with the overexpression of BAP1-mutant (Δ221-238) enhanced the HR-DNA repair defects and the PARP inhibitors sensitivity. […] CCDC6 was barely detected in 30% of the tumors that also carried BAP1 defects.

In this study, we investigated whether MPM cells with BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) loss show the same morphological characteristics identified in MPM cells with 9p21 HD. […] MPM cells with either BAP1 loss detected by immunocytochemistry (ICC) or 9p21 HD detected by FISH were identified via virtual microscopy prior to ICC or FISH, followed by analysis and quantification of their morphological characteristics. […] MPM cells with BAP1 loss or 9p21 HD exhibited significantly more frequent cell-in-cell engulfment, multinucleation, and larger multicellular clusters composed of more than 10 cells than reactive mesothelial cells. […] In conclusion, MPM cells with BAP1 loss or 9p21 HD share similar cytological features, indicating that the same morphological criteria can be used to detect MPM cells harboring such genetic aberrations.

Loss of function of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is observed in about 50% of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cases. […] A genetically engineered model was established expressing either functional or nonfunctional BAP1, and whole-genome siRNA synthetic lethality screens were performed assessing differentially impaired survival between the two cell lines. […] The whole-genome siRNA screen unexpectedly revealed 11 hits (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05) that were more cytotoxic to &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;-proficient cells. […] In line with the screen results, primary mesothelioma (&lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt;) overexpressing &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; C91A (catalytically dead mutant) was more resistant to RNR inhibition, while &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;-proficient cell lines rescued the cells from their vulnerability to RNR depletion. […] Gemcitabine and hydroxyurea were more cytotoxic in &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;-proficient cell line-derived spheroids compared with &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; deficient. […] Upregulation of RRM2 upon gemcitabine and hydroxyurea treatment was more profound in &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; mut/del cell lines. […] Increased lethality mediated by RNR inhibition was observed in NCI-H2452 cells reconstituted with &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt;-WT but not with &lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; C91A. […] Upregulation of RRM2 in NCI-H2452-&lt;i&gt;BAP1&lt;/i&gt; WT spheroids was modest compared with control or C91A mutant. […] Together, we found that BAP1 is involved in the regulation of RNR levels during replication stress.

[…] The diagnostic performance of &lt;i&gt;p16&lt;/i&gt;, BAP1 and our classification models were compared using ROC analysis. […] It was observed that BAP1 loss and &lt;i&gt;p16&lt;/i&gt; deletion were highly specific for MPM, since they were not detected in benign lesions. […] However, their AUC values were not completely satisfying (BAP1: 0.8235; &lt;i&gt;p16&lt;/i&gt;: 0.7647) particularly due to their low sensitivities. […] As expected, combining BAP1 and &lt;i&gt;p16&lt;/i&gt; tests increased the diagnostic sensitivity, thus improving the AUC (0.8824).

[…] The remaining two lesions had different somatic mutations in genes other than BAP1. […] Multiple BAP1-deficient cancers that developed in a single patient suggest the newly identified germline variant of BAP1 gene to be pathogenic and this case expands the clinical spectrum of BAP1-tumor predisposition syndrome.

The prognostic role of BRCA1 associated protein-1 (BAP1) expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a matter of debate. […] We aimed to clarify whether MPM patients with loss of BAP1 expression have better overall survival (OS) compared to BAP1 positive patients. […] BAP1 immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples from 60 MPM patients treated at our institution with first-line chemotherapy was evaluated. […] Only cohort studies that investigated BAP1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reported hazard ratio (HR) values for OS obtained through multivariate analysis (or adjusted for histotype) were considered. […] In our cohort, 23 samples (38 %) were BAP1 positive/retained (≥1 %) and 37 samples (62 %) were BAP1 negative/loss. […] BAP1 loss was associated with epithelioid histotype (p 0.01). […] Median OS times were 14.8 months (95 % CI: 10.7-29.3) and 18.1 months (95 % CI: 11.2-25.8) for negative and positive BAP1 expression, respectively (p 0.2). […] Similarly, the meta-analysis consisting of 698 patients showed no difference in terms of OS according to BAP1 status (HR 1.11; 95 % CI, 0·76-1·61; p 0.60). […] BAP1 expression is not an independent prognostic factor for MPM patients and it should not be considered without taking into account tumor histotype.
&lt;/td&gt;

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether testing for BAP1 and CDKN2A/p16 status in effusion specimens preceding the tissue diagnosis of mesothelioma would improve diagnostic accuracy and allow an earlier diagnosis of malignancy. […] BAP1 immunohistochemistry and p16 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed retrospectively. […] BAP1 or p16 FISH testing revealed a loss in 7 of 18 (39%) samples originally categorized as benign/reactive, 20 of 33 (61%) interpretable samples categorized as atypical, and 10 of 14 (71%) cases suspicious for mesothelioma. […] Similarly, loss of BAP1 or p16 was found in 28 of 30 (93%) samples categorized as malignant, with some cases diagnosable up to 6 months before biopsy. […] Overall, loss of BAP1 and/or CDKN2A/p16 homozygous deletion would change the diagnostic interpretation in 37 of 60 (62%) (P = .07) effusion specimens, particularly in pleural effusions (32 of 48 samples) (P = .002). […] The sensitivity of morphologic interpretation alone was 30.3%; however, adding testing for BAP1 and p16 resulted in an increase in sensitivity to 68.7%. […] These findings suggest that routine use of BAP1 immunochemistry and p16 FISH as adjunctive tests improves the diagnostic accuracy of cytology specimens and potentially allows an earlier diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.
&lt;/td&gt;

In particular, we generated a new HMC line harboring a germline mutation in BAP1, a causal tumor suppressor gene, that could be instrumental to malignant mesothelioma research.
