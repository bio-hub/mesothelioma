Expression of the Met receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been observed in 74% to 100% and 40% to 85% of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) specimens, respectively. […] HGF stimulation has been shown to enhance MPM cell proliferation, migration, cell scattering, and invasiveness. […] Two of the cell lines, H2461 and JMN-1B, exhibited autocrine HGF production as measured by ELISA (3.9 and 10.5 ng/mL, respectively, versus &lt;0.05 ng/mL in other cell lines). […] Evaluation of PHA-665752 across the 10 MPM cell lines indicated that despite Met expression in all cell lines, only in cell lines that exhibited a Met/HGF autocrine loop, H2461 and JMN-1B, did PHA-665752 inhibit growth with an IC(50) of 1 and 2 micromol/L, respectively. […] Growth of H2461 cells was also inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to HGF and by RNA interference knockdown of the Met receptor, confirming that growth inhibition observed was through a Met-dependent mechanism. […] Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of the Met receptor may be an effective therapeutic strategy for patients with MPM and provides a mechanism, the presence of a HGF/Met autocrine loop, by which to select patients for PHA-665752 treatment.

Expression in MPM tissues by immunohistochemistry was increased (82%) in MPM in general compared with normal. c-Met was internalized with its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in H28 MPM cells, with robust expression of c-Met. […] Serum circulating HGF was twice as high in mesothelioma patients as in healthy controls. […] There was a differential growth response and activation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in response to HGF for the various cell lines. […] Abrogation of HGF-induced c-Met and downstream signaling was seen in mesothelioma cells.

The MET receptor and its ligand HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) play important roles in cell growth, survival and migration, and dysregulation of the HGF-MET pathway leads to oncogenic changes including tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. […] New drugs targeted against MET and HGF are currently being investigated in vitro and in vivo, with promising results. […] These drugs function at a variety of steps within the HGF-MET pathway, including MET expression at the RNA or protein level, the ligand-receptor interaction, and tyrosine kinase function.

NK4 exhibits two distinct biological actions: antagonistic inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) through binding to the Met/HGF receptor, and antiangiogenic action through binding to perlecan. […] For EHMES-10 cells, HGF facilitated invasion of the cells in collagen gel, whereas NK4 and neutralizing anti-HGF antibody suppressed the HGF-induced invasion. […] In addition, NK4 but not anti-HGF antibody suppressed proliferation of EHMES-10 cells in collagen, suggesting that the suppression by NK4 was independent of the HGF-Met pathway. […] In all the 7 mesothelioma lines, HGF stimulated Met tyrosine phosphorylation, and this was associated with enhanced cell migration. […] HGF-dependent Met activation and migration were inhibited by NK4. […] Thus, the simultaneous inhibition of the HGF-Met pathway and angiogenesis by NK4 for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma is significant, particularly to attenuate migration and invasive growth.

MSTO-211H and Y-Meso-14 cells produced fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and/or platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA); they also enhanced growth, migration, and production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells. […] MRC-5 cells stimulated HGF-mediated growth and migration of MSTO-211H and Y-Meso-14 cells in an in vitro coculture system. […] In the orthotopic model, tumor formation by MSTO-211H and Y-Meso-14 cells was significantly inhibited by TSU-68, an inhibitor of FGF, VEGF, and PDGF receptors; imatinib, an inhibitor of PDGF receptors; and NK4, an antagonist of HGF.

By regulating cell functions such as growth, survival, motility/migration, and invasion, the c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (c-MET) receptor tyrosine kinase/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) axis accounts for a critical pathway in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signal pathway is up-regulated in human mesothelioma and suppression of the HGF/c-Met signaling with a competitive inhibitor, NK4 homologous to HGF in the structure, produced anti-tumor effects to mesothelioma in a preclinical study. […] The clinical investigation is a first-in-human trial to use the NK4 gene and to block the HGF/c-Met pathway with gene medicine. […] The clinical study can also provide information regarding production of NK4 protein and antibody against NK4, and inhibition levels of the HGF/c-Met pathway by detecting dephosphorylation of c-Met in mesothelioma cells.

In the majority of mesotheliomas, up-regulated expression or signalling by Met, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can be demonstrated. […] Here we describe the HGF/Met axis and review the mechanisms that lead to the aberrant activation of this signalling system in mesothelioma. […] We also describe the cross-talk that occurs between HGF/Met and a number of other receptors, ligands and co-receptor systems. […] The prevalent occurrence of HGF/Met dysregulation in patients with mesothelioma sets the scene for the investigation of pharmaceutical inhibitors of this axis. […] In light of the inter-relationship between HGF/Met and other ligand receptor, combinatorial targeting strategies may provide opportunities for therapeutic advancement in this challenging tumour.

Fibronectin and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were produced by lung fibroblasts. […] Exogenous fibronectin and HGF also enhanced the migration and invasion of the three MPM cells, respectively. […] Neutralizing anti-HGF antibody inhibited the invasion of H28 cells enhanced by fibroblast-derived media. […] In addition, the production of fibronectin and HGF was stimulated by MPM cell-derived media.

Candidate MET-specific CARs were engineered in which a CD28+CD3ζ endodomain was fused to one of 3 peptides derived from the N and K1 domains of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which represents the minimum MET binding element present in this growth factor. […] By contrast, these CARs did not mediate T-cell activation upon engagement of other HGF binding partners, namely CD44v6 or heparan sulfate proteoglycans, including Syndecan-1.

Pleural effusion from 42 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), 36 patients with adenocarcinoma (AD) and 40 benign (BE) effusions were analyzed for 10 different analytes that, in previous studies, were associated with angiogenesis, consisting of Angiopoietin-1, HGF, MMP-7, Osteopontin, TIMP-1, Galectin, Mesothelin, NRG1-b1, Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) and VEGF by a Human Premixed Multi-Analyte Luminex kit. […] Galectin-1, HGF, Mesothelin, MMP-7, Osteopontin, shed SDC-1, NRG1-β1, VEGF and TIMP-1 were significantly higher in malignant pleural mesothelioma effusions compared to benign samples. […] Additionally, Galectin-1, HGF, Mesothelin, MMP-7, Osteopontin, shed SDC-1 and TIMP-1 can be diagnostic for malignant cases.

Paraffin sections from 29 lung carcinomas (28 primary and 1 metastatic) and 9 pleural malignant mesotheliomas were immunostained with antisera to human hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor, met. […] For HGF/SF, immunoreactivity was demonstrated in all 9 mesotheliomas, 9 of 12 adenocarcinomas, and 7 of 10 squamous cell carcinomas. […] The adenocarcinomas frequently showed enhanced luminal staining, suggesting possible secretion of HGF/SF, and this pattern of staining was also seen occasionally in bronchial epithelium adjacent to the tumour. […] Stromal fibroblasts also showed immunoreactivity for HGF/SF in 6/8 cases of mesothelioma but in only 3/12 adenocarcinomas, 1/10 squamous cell carcinomas, and 1/4 small cell anaplastic carcinomas. […] This study demonstrates the presence of HGF/SF and met in most of the tumour types described, particularly mesotheliomas, and suggests that the HGF/SF/met signalling system may play a role in the development of these tumours, either by autocrine or by paracrine mechanisms.

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor c-met are present in several human tissues but their expression in mesothelial cells has not been examined. […] In this study, we have investigated the expression of HGF and c-met in normal human mesothelial cells and 11 human malignant mesothelioma cell lines. […] Using RT-PCR and Western blotting we found that HGF is produced by 3/11 mesothelioma cell lines whereas c-met is expressed in 11/11 mesothelioma cell lines. […] In contrast, neither normal cultured mesothelial cells nor mesothelial cells obtained directly from patients without mesothelioma expressed HGF nor c-met. […] We have also analysed the biological function of HGF and c-met in mesothelioma cell lines. […] Recombinant human (rh) HGF stimulated both directional (chemotactic) and random (chemokinetic) motility in all mesothelioma cell lines tested. […] Furthermore, mesothelioma serum free conditioned medium containing HGF stimulated mesothelioma cell migration. […] This effect could be blocked in the presence of neutralizing anti-HGF monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in the assay. […] Addition of HGF to mesothelioma cells cultured on collagen type IV was associated with induction of bipolar shape and protrusion of prominent pseudopodia. […] We have also found that rhHGF was mitogenic for mesothelioma cells. […] Our findings suggest that expression of HGF/c-met is involved not only in mesothelioma progression but also in its growth and migration and that c-met expression found in mesothelioma cells taken directly from patients may be of diagnostic importance.

The expression of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) was studied in 12 mesothelioma cell lines characterized by either an epithelioid or a fibroblast-like phenotype. […] Conditioned media from these lines were analysed by bioassay and ELISA, and HGF/SF was detected in three cell lines, all with a fibroblast-like or mixed morphology. […] Thus, for these cell lines, the ability to secrete HGF/SF correlated with the cell phenotype. […] Both cell lines expressed the Met receptor but only BR secreted HGF/SF. […] Both cell lines responded to exogenous HGF/SF treatment by a change of morphology but in different ways: BR became more elongated and bipolar, while BT formed more spread-out cell colonies. […] HGF/SF acted as a paracrine effector on the epithelioid BT cells and stimulated both cell-spreading and proliferation. […] Interestingly, BT cells spread but did not scatter in response to exogenous HGF/SF. […] In contrast BR cells showed only some stimulation of cell motility with HGF/SF and no increase in cell proliferation was observed. […] Because HGF/SF was previously found in the pleural effusion fluids of patients with malignant mesothelioma and in paraffin-embedded tumour tissues, it is concluded that HGF/SF may well stimulate the growth and spread of malignant mesothelioma in vivo by paracrine and/or autocrine mechanisms.

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) stimulates cell proliferation, motility and invasiveness via its receptor c-Met during embryogenesis and repair processes. […] Co-expression of HGF/SF and c-Met receptor results in enhanced tumour growth, invasiveness and a mesenchymal-epithelial transition in some experimental tumours. […] Since mesothelioma cells have been reported to express c-Met receptor and to migrate in response to HGF/SF, we investigated human malignant pleural mesotheliomas for the demonstration of possible co-expression of the growth factor and its receptor. […] The microvessel density of the tumours was also analysed in order to assess the influence of HGF/SF expression on tumour angiogenesis. […] Thirty-nine paraffin-embedded specimens of malignant pleural mesotheliomas were immunostained by anti-HGF/SF and anti-c-Met antibodies and semiquantitatively evaluated. c-Met mRNA expression was visualised in ten tumour samples by a fluorescent in situ hybridisation method. […] We found an increased production of HGF/SF in 33/39 tumours and a corresponding overexpression of c-Met receptor in 29/39 specimens. […] HGF/SF-positive mesotheliomas had significantly higher microvessel densities compared to their HGF/SF-negative counterparts. […] The observed co-expression of HGF/SF and c-Met in malignant pleural mesotheliomas suggests a possible self-stimulation (autocrine loop) of tumour cells. […] On the basis of the significantly higher microvessel density values of malignant mesotheliomas overexpressing HGF/SF, we postulate, that HGF/SF may be an additional relevant factor in tumour angiogenesis in malignant pleural mesotheliomas.
