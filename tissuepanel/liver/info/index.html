[…] For liver cancer, the cumulative risk estimate was calculated to be 40 per 10(4) person Sv (radiation weighting factor = 20).

We discuss the role of surgery with either radical extrapleural pleuropneumonectomy or less invasive palliative pleurectomy and decortication, and the role of radiotherapy, in which the main problem is how to deliver sufficient doses to the pleural surface, sparing radiosensitive structures such as the lung, heart, liver, and kidneys.

To compare treatment plans for multileaf collimators (MLCs) with different leaf widths and different finite pencil beam (FPB) sizes, to determine the planning quality and delivery efficiency of segmented MLC (SMLC) delivery of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] The number of monitor units, the number of segments, and delivery times were used to evaluate delivery efficiency. […] The doses to clinical target volume, spinal cord, lung, liver, heart, and contralateral kidney were acceptable with all three beam models. […] The plan generated with the 1 x 1-cm2 model required the least amount of time to deliver. […] The quality of the MPM IMRT plans generated with the three beam models presented here was similar; however, the 1 x 1-cm2 model provided the most efficient delivery of MPM IMRT with the CORVUS planning system.

[…] In BNCT for MPM, when the mean lung dose to the normal ipsilateral lung was 5 Gy-Eq, the mean dose delivered to the MPM tumor by AB-BNCT and RB-BNCT was 20.2 and 19.9 Gy-Eq, respectively.

As accurate light delivery is imperative to PDT efficacy, the deformation of the pleural volume during the surgery is studied on its impact on the delivered light fluence. […] In this study, a three-dimensional finite element-based (3D FEM) deformable image registration is proposed to directly match the volume of lung to the volume of pleural cavity obtained during PDT to have accurate representation of the light fluence accumulated in the lung, heart and liver (organs-at-risk) during treatment. […] A wand, comprised of a modified endotrachial tube filled with Intralipid and an optical fiber inside the tube, is used to deliver the treatment light. […] The lung, heart, and liver geometry are also reconstructed from a series of computed tomography (CT) scans of the organs acquired in the same patient before and after the surgery. […] The delivered fluence values are assigned to the respective positions (x, y, and z) on the optical tracking contour. […] The volume of lung was matched to the volume of pleural cavity and the distribution of light fluence on the surface of the heart, liver and deformed lung volumes was obtained.

However, malignant mesothelioma of the liver is extremely rare and coexistence with malignant mesothelioma of the greater omentum has not been described in the literature. […] In this case report, we present a case of multiple malignant mesothelioma of the liver and greater omentum. […] Abdominal contrast computed tomography showed a cystic mass measuring 13 × 14 × 11 cm in the right liver lobe with enhanced mural nodule. […] Abnormal accumulation was identified in the liver and lower abdominal area on <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.

However, the efficacy of RT is limited by the large volume of the target to be irradiated (tumor and pleural cavity) and the radiosensitivity of the nearby organs (heart, liver, lung, spinal cord, and esophagus).

Here, we report a case of primary malignant mesothelioma of the diaphragm with liver invasion. […] A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of a “liver space-occupying lesion,” without any special clinical symptoms. […] Imaging examinations suggested a cystic-solid mixed lesion in the right lobe of the liver. […] The tumor was diagnosed as epithelioid mesothelioma of the diaphragm with liver invasion. […] The patient underwent abdominal surgery in our hospital to remove the diaphragmatic mass, liver mass, and part of the diaphragm. […] Primary diaphragmatic malignant mesothelioma is very rare and may involve liver or lung tissue and be mistaken for liver or lung tumor. […] Immunohistochemical staining is very useful to distinguish this tumor from other liver or diaphragmatic tumors.
