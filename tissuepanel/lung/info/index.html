Asbestos causes four diseases in humans: Lung fibrosis (asbestosis) follows heavy exposure and, in industrialized countries, is mainly a relic of past working conditions. […] The risk of lung cancer seems to be linearly related to cumulative asbestos exposure, with an estimated increase in risk of 1% for each fibre/ml-year of exposure. […] All fibre types seem to exert a similar effect on lung cancer risk; a multiplicative interaction with tobacco smoking has been suggested.

More than half of these cases were lung cancer, most caused either by asbestos (n=545) or by ionizing radiation ((italic)n(/italic)=306).

Clinical and epidemiologic studies have established incontrovertibly that chrysotile causes cancer of the lung, malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, cancer of the larynx and certain gastrointestinal cancers.

Increased levels of some of these products were reported in lung cancer patients after occupational asbestos exposure and after exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or vinylchloride. […] In the first step, this study investigated the possible diagnostic value of serum EGF-R, p53-protein and anti-p53 antibodies, measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in lung tumour patients. […] In addition to being investigated on a molecular epidemiological basis, these parameters were examined as biomarkers of carcinogenesis, especially with regard to asbestos incorporation effects or of radon-induced lung cancers. […] A total of 116 male patients with lung or pleural tumours were examined. […] The histological classification was four small-cell cancers, six large-cell cancers, 32 adenocarcinomas, 47 squamous carcinomas, 12 mixed lung carcinomas, five diffuse malignant mesotheliomas and ten lung metastasis of extrapulmonary tumours. […] Twenty-two lung cancers and all mesotheliomas were related to asbestos, 22 lung cancers were related to ionizing radiation and 61 patients had cigarette smoke-related lung cancer. […] Besides these patients 50 male patients with non-malignant lung or pleural diseases were included; of the latter eight subjects suffered from asbestosis. […] Controls were 129 male subjects without any lung disease. […] The utility of p53-protein, EGF-R and anti-p53 antibodies as routine biomarkers for screening occupationally derived lung cancers is limited.

Because we experienced each 1 operative case of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma of the lung discovered with pleural effusion, clinical comparison investigated both. […] But the pathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the lung, what is so called pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma. […] In clinical differential diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma of the lung, history of inhalation of asbestos and concentrations of hyaluronic acid in pleural effusion are helpful.

In this study, we sought to determine if differences in uPAR expression were distinguishable between cultured human lung carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma subtypes. […] We also sought to determine if, as in malignant mesothelioma cells, uPAR expression is regulated at the posttranscriptional level in cultured malignant lung carcinoma cells. […] Using 125I-uPA binding and ligand blotting techniques, uPAR was expressed by phenotypically diverse lung carcinoma cell lines, including the H460, H157 and H1395 non-small cell lines and the H146 small cell lung carcinoma line. […] Expression of uPAR and its message in cultured lung carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma cells is similarly influenced by effectors present in the tumor microenvironment. […] Regulation of the uPAR message occurs at the posttranscriptional level in cultured small and non-small cell lung carcinoma cells as well as spindle-shaped and fibrous malignant mesothelioma cell lines.

The distinction between malignant pleural mesotheliomas and adenocarcinomas, particularly those originating in the lung, is a difficult diagnostic problem that can be facilitated by the use of immunohistochemical markers. […] After analyzing the results, it was concluded that E-cadherin and BG8 are useful markers for distinguishing between epithelial mesotheliomas and adenocarcinomas of various origins, including the lung. […] Because TTF-1 expression is found almost exclusively in adenocarcinomas of the lung but is absent in mesotheliomas, immunostaining for this marker is particularly useful for distinguishing between these two malignancies.

An internationally established questionnaire with 29 questions, covering the most characteristic activities of asbestos exposure at the workplace was completed for 300 patients with respiratory malignancies, i.e. 297 patients with lung cancer and three with mesothelioma of the pleura. […] Additionally, lung X-rays were classified and the national data on the incidence of malignant pleura mesothelioma were analysed. […] A cumulative asbestos exposure of 25 fibre-years or more was detected in 11 patients with lung cancer (4%) and in each of the three patients with pleural mesothelioma (100%). […] Additionally, results of the lung tissue fibre counts by scanning transmission electron microscopy were available for 25 of the lung cancer patients. […] The annual incidence of lung cancer in Hungary is about 6,000. […] Since in our series of lung cancer patients about 4% were observed, which could be accepted as representing occupational disease because of a cumulative exposure to 25 fibre-years or more, the annual asbestos related lung tumour incidences may be estimated to be approximately 150 or more. […] The proportion of nearly two estimated cases of lung cancer per case of pleural mesothelioma corresponds to international experience. […] Up to now, lung cancer cases only exceptionally have been registered as occupational diseases, i.e. they were seriously under-diagnosed in Hungary.

The study group comprised a collective of 1,605 patients with malignant mesotheliomas and with lung tissue available for lung dust analyses. […] Clinical features, occupational histories, expositions and individual data were evaluated, and the asbestos bodies concentrations (asbestos bodies/cm3 lung tissue or g wet tissue) were determined. […] There was no association between histological subtypes and the asbestos burden of the lungs. […] Patients with peritoneal mesotheliomas had distinctly higher asbestos burdens in the lungs than patients with pleural mesotheliomas. […] There exists no association between lung asbestos burdens and survival times. […] A trend: higher asbestos burden of the lung/shorter latency periods was suggested. […] Of the patients, 25.6% had asbestos-associated lung fibroses, in 40.7% of the cases pleural plaques were identified.

Mutations of the Kristen ras (K-ras) gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, and have been proposed to be a prognostic factor. […] Malignant pleural effusion is a common complication of lung cancer. […] The causes of pleural effusion were non-small cell lung cancer (18 cases), small cell lung cancer (6 cases), malignant mesothelioma (2 cases), metastatic lung tumor (5 cases), thymoma (1 case), malignant lymphoma (1 case), and pleuritis tuberculosa (7 cases).

The pathological distinction between malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)and adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of the lung can be cumbersome using established methods.

[…] Here we have tested the fidelity of ratio-based diagnosis in differentiating between MPM and lung cancer in 181 tissue samples (31 MPM and 150 ADCA). […] Using two and three expression ratios, we found that the differential diagnoses of MPM and lung ADCA were 95% and 99% accurate, respectively.

To elucidate the features of the asbestos fibers contributing to the induction of human malignant mesothelioma, we used high-resolution analytical electron microscopy to determine the type, number, and dimensions of asbestos fibers in lung and mesothelial tissues in 168 cases of mesothelioma. […] Asbestos fibers were present in almost all of the lung and mesothelial tissues from the mesothelioma cases. […] The most common types of asbestos fibers in lung were either an admixture of chrysotile with amphiboles, amphibole alone, and occasionally chrysotile alone. […] In lung, amosite fibers were greatest in number followed by chrysotile, crocidolite, tremolite/actinolite, and anthophyllite. […] In some mesothelioma cases, the only asbestos fibers detected in either lung or mesothelial tissue were chrysotile fibers. […] The average number of asbestos fibers in both lung and mesothelial tissues was two orders of magnitude greater than the number found in the general population. […] The majority of asbestos fibers in lung and mesothelial tissues were shorter than 5 micro m in length. […] 1) Fiber analysis of both lung and mesothelial tissues must be done to determine the types of asbestos fibers associated with the induction of human malignant mesothelioma; 2) short, thin asbestos fibers should be included in the list of fiber types contributing to the induction of human malignant mesothelioma; 3) RESULTS support the induction of human malignant mesothelioma by chrysotile.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung is challenging because of substantial drawbacks. […] However, lung pathologies that are associated with increased attenuation values in CT enhance visualization in MRI: proton density is increased and tissue-air interfaces, resulting in susceptibility artifacts, are reduced in pneumonia, pneumonitis, edema, and carcinoma. […] On the other hand, many lung diseases result in shortness of breath, so that patients cannot hold their breath for long periods. […] With parallel imaging techniques, MRI examination of the lungs can be performed with short periods of breath holding, which allow for sub-centimeter resolution in the z-axis. […] Especially for follow-up examinations in immunocompromised patients and, in some instances, for the staging of malignant diseases (malignant pleural mesothelioma, lung cancer, respectively), MRI is very promising and may contribute to a decrease in the radiation exposure of the patients.

[…] Statistically significantly increased methylation in MM versus non-tumor lung samples was found for estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; p = 0.0002), solute carrier family 6 member 20 (SLC6A20; p = 0.0022) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK; p=0.0003).

Asbestos fibers and ferruginous bodies (FBs) in lung parenchyma, lung cancer tissues, pleural plaques, and pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma tissues from 13 North American insulation workers were analyzed and quantified using an analytical transmission electron microscope and a polarized microscope. […] Diseases from which these workers suffered included asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. […] Large numbers of FBs were found in the lungs and small numbers found in extrapulmonary sites. […] In all instances, lung parenchyma and lung cancer tissues showed chrysotile and amosite fibers in high concentrations (63.1 x 10(6) and 150.2 x 10(6) fibers/g dry tissue as mean values, respectively). […] In pleural plaques and in pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma tissues, amosite fibers were markedly fewer in number, whereas chrysotile fibers were seen in similar numbers as in the lungs. […] These results strongly suggest that translocation of inhaled asbestos fibers from the lung to other tissues, such as the pleura and the peritoneum, occurs frequently, and that chrysotile may be more actively translocated from the lung, compared to amosite or amphibole asbestos.

The aim of this communication is to report the initial results obtained comparing the size of amphibole fibres from healthy lung tissue with those from pleural tissue sampled from subjects whose death cause of death was mesothelioma. […] The most important characteristics of the detected fibres were: the average length offibres from the lung and pleural tissues taken from the same subject did not difer, in all cases, by more than 10-12%; 95% offibres found in the lung tissues of all subjects had a length greater than 5 microm; 98% of fibres found in the pleural tissues had a length greater than 5 microm; the average diameter of the fibres found in the pleural tissues was 70% of the diameter of the fibres from the lung tissues. […] The experimental data obtained in this study confirm the correlation between malignant mesothelioma and the presence in the lung and pleural tissues of fibres with a length greater, even much greater, than 4-5 microm; thus the hypothesis that the chief factors inducing mesothelioma are the “ultrashort” and “ultrathin” fibres appears rather weak.

In many previous studies, the asbestos fibres retained in the lung were regarded as a good index of cumulative occupational asbestos exposure. […] Samples of lung tissues were collected for electron microscopy analysis to measure the asbestos fibre burden of the lungs in workers with high exposure, and assess the possible correlation between asbestos fibre lung burden and the estimated levels of cumulative exposure. […] Samples of lung parenchyma obtained from a consecutive series of 12 post-mortem examinations that were performed between 1994 and 2007and included 5 cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma, 4 lung cancers, 1 case of asbestosis and2 ofpleuralplagues, were collected, stored and analysed by SEM electron microscopy, according to the methods suggested by the current scientific literature. […] A wide variation of total asbestos fibre concentrations in the lung (1,320-118 million) was observed; in all 12 workers, the lung amphibole fibre burden exceeded 1,000,000 fibres per g/dry tissue, The highest values were detected in the mesothelioma cases, in which the mean fibre concentrations differed statistically (t=2.29, p=0.045) from the mean calculated for the other asbestos-related diseases; in 9 subjects only amphibole fibres were detected. […] This study, which was numerically the biggest ever performed in Italy for this category of workers, confirms a wide range of total asbestos fibre burden in heavily occupationally exposed workers and showed that of the asbestos-related diseases, the highest lung concentrations of asbestos fibres were reached in cases of mesothelioma. […] It was also observed that almost the entire lung burden consists of only amphibole fibres, all exceeding 1 million per gramme of dry tissue.

Although it is widely accepted that exposure to any asbestos type can increase the likelihood of lung cancer, mesothelioma, and non-malignant lung and pleural disorders, manufacturers and some chrysotile miners’ unions contend that chrysotile either does not cause disease or that there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion. […] Bernstein has published several animal studies, financed by the Québec Chrysotile Institute, to determine chrysotile biopersistence in the lungs. […] Bernstein’s results can only be explained by an aggressive pre-treatment of fibers, inducing many faults and fragility in the fibers’ structure, leading to rapid hydration and breaking of long fibers in the lungs.

[…] This differential expression might well molecularly explain the differential clinical activity of pemetrexed in the various histotypes of lung cancer, including the marginal activity in small-cell lung cancer.

Four patients (15%) experienced grade 5 lung toxicity, i.e. pneumonitis 19-40 days after the completion of radiotherapy. […] Patients with pneumonitis had a significantly larger lung volume fraction receiving 10 Gy or more (V10) (median: 60.3%, range 56.4-83.2%) compared to patients without pneumonitis (median: 52.6%, range: 25.6-80.3%) (p=0.02). […] Mean lung dose (MLD) was also significantly higher in patients who developed pneumonitis (median 13.9 Gy, range: 13.6-14.2 Gy) than in patients who did not (median=12.4 Gy, range: 8.4-15.4 Gy) (p=0.04). […] Significant differences in MLD and V10 for patients with fatal pulmonary toxicity compared to patients without fatal lung toxicity have been demonstrated.

New data questioned the widely held belief at that time that the carcinogenic effects of asbestos in the development of lung cancer and MM were due to genotoxic or mutagenic effects. […] Later studies by our group revealed that proto-oncogene expression and several of the signaling pathways activated by asbestos were redox dependent, explaining why antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes were elevated in lung and pleura after exposure to asbestos and how they alleviated many of the phenotypic and functional effects of asbestos in vitro or after inhalation. […] Of considerable significance is the fact that the signal transduction pathways activated by asbestos are also important in survival and chemoresistance of MMs and lung cancers.

The chest radiograph is the mainstay in the imaging evaluation of asbestos-exposed individuals, providing an inexpensive and rapid appraisal of the presence of both focal and diffuse abnormalities of the pleura and lung parenchyma. […] Conventional (whole-thorax) CT may be an important adjunct in the following situations: (1) to clarify the presence of pleural thickening, particularly in distinguishing pleural disease from normal extrapleural soft tissues; (2) to stage and determine tumor extent in malignant pleural mesothelioma; (3) to identify optimal sites for biopsy of suspicious pleural changes; and (4) to detect and characterize lung cancers or other focal masses that may be obscured by extensive pleural or parenchymal fibrosis. […] In individuals with combined cigarette smoking-asbestos exposure in whom symptoms or functional abnormalities are present, HRCT may play a central role in distinguishing emphysematous lung destruction from the peripheral interstitial changes of asbestosis.

In this study, we evaluated the value of immunostaining pattern for podoplanin to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinomas of various origins.Cell blocks from previously collected paraffin-embedded cell blocks of 86 effusions (18 mesothelioma, 35 reactive mesothelium, 9 breast adenocarcinoma, 14 ovarian adenocarcinoma, and 10 lung adenocarcinoma) were retrieved from the file of the Department of Pathology at University of Michigan and Lund University in Sweden and were used for the study. […] The intensity of positive results was evaluated as strong, moderate, or weak.Podoplanin is expressed in 94% of malignant mesothelioma cases (17/18), 97% (30/31) of cases of reactive mesothelial, 0% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (0/9), 0% of breast adenocarcinoma (0/9), and 7% of ovarian adenocarcinoma (1/14). […] The one positive case of ovarian adenocarcinoma showed a weak membranous podoplanin immunostaining.On the basis of our results and published data, we believe that membranous podoplanin immunoreactivity, in conjunction with calretinin, would be more specific than CK5/6 and WT-1 in differentiating epithelioid malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma of the lung, breast, and ovary.

[…] Sample of lung parenchyma from necropsies and extrapleural pneumonectomy were collected, stored and analysed by scanning electron microscope, according to the methods recommended in the current scientific literature. […] The highest values of asbestos fibres were detected in all the workers of the former group and in 3 non-asbestos workers (jute recycling employees), with concentrations between 9.1 and 397 million/g of dried lung tissue. […] The total fibre concentration in the other 4 non-asbestos textile workers (silk and cotton production workers) ranged from 0.33 to 1.2 million/g of dried lung tissue. […] In only one of these subjects, did lung amphibole burden exceed 1,000,000 amphibole fibres longer than 1 microm per g of dried tissue. […] We detected amphibole fibres in all the “non-asbestos” textile workers and for two of them a higher concentration of tremolite. i) Among textile workers using asbestos or jute recycling, the asbestos fibre burden is as high as that found in other high risk jobs (e.g. asbestos-cement workers); ii) among non-asbestos textile workers, employed in cotton and silk production, the fibre content in lung tissue was much lower and it was nonetheless above the occupational cut-off for one of them; iii) tremolite found in lung tissue of non-asbestos textile workers with MM could be a contaminant of chrysotile friction materials or originate, with other amphiboles, from some other source as yet to be investigated.

[…] TTF-1 is also expressed in adenocarcinomas of the lung and is widely used as a pulmonary adenocarcinoma marker in surgical specimens. […] These data indicate that TTF-1 maintains its sensitivity (73%) and specificity (100%) in cell block preparations and is useful in separating adenocarcinoma of the lung from non-pulmonary adenocarcinoma and malignant mesothelioma in cytology specimens.

Exposure to asbestos may cause asbestos-related non-malignant diseases of the lung and pleura, including asbestosis, pleural plaques, diffuse pleural fibrosis, small airway disease, and malignant diseases such as lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma. […] Inhaled asbestos fibres deposit in the distal regions of the respiratory system where they interact with epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, and trigger active immunological response which leads to a slowly progressing lung fibrosis.

In this study, we examined the expression status and aberrant methylaion of p21 in lung cancers and malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM). […] We used 12 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines, 13 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, 50 primary NSCLCs, 6 MPM cell lines and 10 primary MPMs. […] Loss of p21 expression was frequently observed in lung cancers and MPMs and aberrant methylation was one of the mechanisms of suppression of p21, especially in NSCLCs.

Pemetrexed is a clinically available anti-folate therapeutic agent used in combination with cisplatin for the management of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer. […] In the current study, we examined the downstream effect of pemetrexed in inducing apoptosis in lung cancer cells. […] Thus, our findings demonstrate the efficacy and mechanistic underpinnings of pemetrexed-induced apoptosis, and they suggest pemetrexed may have clinical utility when used in combination with TRAIL for the management of patients with lung cancer.

Tissue kallikrein (KLK1) and plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) may regulate the growth and proliferation of tumours of the lung and pleura, through the generation of kinin peptides that signal through the kinin B(1) (BDKRB1) and B(2) (BDKRB2) receptors. […] The aim of this study was to assess whether expression of the kallikrein-kinin genes in lung cancer and mesothelioma cells is regulated by DNA methylation. […] Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunocytochemistry showed differences in the basal expression of the kallikrein-kinin genes and proteins in lung carcinoma and mesothelioma cells, compared with non-malignant lung epithelial and mesothelial cells, respectively. […] Following treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), KLKB1 mRNA expression was consistently increased in both lung carcinoma and mesothelioma cells, whereas KLK1, BDKRB1 and BDKRB2 mRNA expression was decreased or unchanged. […] Increased expression of KLKB1 after 5-AZA treatment suggests it may function as a tumour suppressor gene in cancers of the lung and pleura.

Asbestos bodies (AB) have long been recognized in light microscopic (LM) sections of pulmonary hilar lymph nodes (LN) from patients with asbestos-related diseases, but the presence of AB on LM has not been correlated with the lung AB burden. […] The purpose of the present study was to determine whether AB in histologic sections of LN are indicative of heavy lung asbestos burdens. […] Twenty cases (17 with asbestosis, 15 with carcinoma of the lung, and two with malignant pleural mesothelioma) with at least one AB on a hilar LN section were identified. […] Bleach digestion of lung tissue in 15 cases demonstrated a median of 24,000 AB/g by LM and 44,000 AB/g by scanning electron microscopy. […] Digestion of hilar nodes demonstrated 21,800, 15,500, and 3,200 AB/g by LM in three cases which had lung burdens of 22,000, 481,000, and 5470 AB/g, respectively. […] A fourth LN specimen contained 322,000 AB/g in a case with no lung available to digest. […] Among fourteen patients with parietal pleural plaques and an elevated lung asbestos body content, AB were observed in iron-stained LN sections in only two cases. […] These two patients had 3240 and 610 AB/g lung tissue, respectively (normal range 0 to 20 AB/g). […] We conclude that the finding of AB on a histologic section of hilar LN is generally indicative of a heavy lung AB burden.(

[…] The Report and Recommendations by the Working Group concluded, “There is evidence of an association between exposure to asbestos and malignant neoplasia.” and “The types of tumors … are … (1) carcinoma of the lungs, and (2) diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum.” This author considers that the causal association between lung cancer or mesothelioma and asbestos was established at the meeting of UICC Working Group in 1964, not by the report on asbestos carcinogenicity in ILO (International Labour Organization) or IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) expert meetings in 1972, as the Japanese government announced.

[…] Diseased (ipsilateral) lung volumes were normalized by the respective contralateral lung volumes to account for the differences in inspiration between scans for each patient. […] A negative correlation was observed between measurements of lung volume and disease volume, and a positive correlation was observed between linear-thickness measurements and disease volume.

[…] It is important for the surgical pathologist to make distinctions between malignant mesothelioma and pleural adenocarcinomas, small cell and non-small cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, and primary and metastatic carcinomas of the lung.

There are basically two surgical approaches to achieve a macroscopic complete resection, lung-sacrificing and lung-sparing. […] Lung-sacrificing surgery, which likely leaves behind the least amount of microscopic disease, is accomplished as an extrapleural pneumonectomy. […] Lung-sparing surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma, on the other hand, does not currently enjoy any degree of consistency. […] Often the selection of a lung-sparing approach is reported as an intraoperative decision that hinges on the bulk of the cancer and/or the degree of extension into the pulmonary fissures. […] This article describes the current evolution of a lung-sparing procedure, radical pleurectomy, which has been used to achieve a macroscopic complete resection in over a hundred patients. […] Whether or not radical pleurectomy is the optimal approach for any or all patients undergoing surgery-based multimodal treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma is not known, but the described technique does offer an operation that can serve as a consistent foundation for any surgery-based treatment strategy where achieving a macroscopic complete resection, while sparing the lung, is desired.

[…] Our results indicate that, in addition to HMFG-2 and CEA, the expression of Leu M1 antigen by most primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma (94%) and its absence in mesothelioma could be used as a valuable marker for primary adenocarcinoma of the lung that involves the pleura and permits its differentiation from mesothelioma.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are small noncoding RNA sequences that negatively regulate the expression of target genes by posttranscriptional repression. miRs are dysregulated in various diseases, including cancer. let-7a miR, an antioncogenic miR, is downregulated in lung cancers.

[…] EphA2 (ephrin type-A receptor 2) tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in most cancer cells, including MPM and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. […] In this study, to enhance the delivery of miR, the miRs were encapsulated in the DOTAP (N-[1-(2.3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium)/Cholesterol/DSPE (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[cyanur(polyethylene glycol)-2000])-PEG (polyethylene glycol)-cyanur liposomal nanoparticles (LNP) and ephrin-A1 was conjugated on the surface of LNP to target receptor EphA2 on lung cancer cells. […] The effectiveness of targeted delivery of let-7a miR encapsulated ephrin-A1 conjugated LNP (miR-ephrin-A1-LNP) was determined on MPM and NSCLC tumor growth in vitro. miR-ephrin-A1-LNP significantly increased the delivery of let-7a miR in lung cancer cells when compared with free let-7a miR.

[…] We propose that an IUR based on an endpoint that combines lung cancer, mesothelioma, and nonmalignant respiratory disease (NMRD) in this cohort would protect against both malignant and nonmalignant disease.

The effects of cisplatin on the lung parenchyma during hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion have not been analysed in detail. […] The objective of this study was to evaluate both the concentration and depth of the penetration of cisplatin in human lung tissue after hyperthermic exposure under ex vivo conditions. […] Twelve patients underwent pulmonary wedge resections after elective thoracic lobectomies were performed (resected lobe), and the lung tissue (approximately 1-2 cm(3)) was incubated (in vitro) with cisplatin (0.05 mg/ml; 60 min, 42°C). […] Cisplatin penetrated into the human lung tissue after ex vivo hyperthermic exposure. […] The median amount of platinum [nmol cisplatin/g lung tissue] decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) depending on the penetration depth: 32 nmol/g (1 mm), 20 nmol/g (2 mm) and 6.8 nmol/g (4 mm). […] Under ex vivo hyperthermic conditions, cisplatin diffused into human lung tissue. […] The penetration of cisplatin into lung tissue may affect the local therapy of residual tumour cells on the lung surface using hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion in patients with malignant pleural tumours.

[…] Because visual assessment is still the preferred method of image interpretation, the diagnostic accuracy of mediastinal pleural thickening, shrinking lung (hemithorax volume decrease due to fibrosis), and pleural pointillism were examined. […] A total of 78 patients received a correct diagnosis (benign vs malignant) on the basis of mediastinal pleural thickening (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 73%; accuracy, 78%); and 66 patients, on the basis of shrinking lung (sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 79%; accuracy, 66%).

We have previously shown that there are differences in the sizes of fibers of amosite asbestos in different parts of the lung in workers with relatively high asbestos exposure and malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] To determine whether this distribution pattern is specific to cases of mesothelioma, we compared the fiber distribution in the lungs of 20 cases of mesothelioma and 10 cases of carcinoma of the lung. […] When individual sampling sites within the lung were considered, neither group showed preferential fiber concentration in any area. […] However, there were definite differences in the intrapulmonary fiber size distribution both within and between the two groups: Cases of mesothelioma showed accumulation of lung fibers in the peripheral upper lobe with shorter central upper lobe fibers. […] The lung cancer cases demonstrated a reverse pattern, with shorter fibers in the peripheral compared to central upper lobe, but accumulations of long fibers in the peripheral lower lobe. […] We conclude that (1) there is no evidence for fiber concentration variations in different portions of the lung; (2) there is strong evidence for variations in fiber sizes in different portions of the lung, and these differences are most clearly related to fiber length, surface area, and mass; (3) contrary to data from experimental animals, there are no clear gravitational effects on fiber distribution in humans; and (4) there are reproducible differences in intrapulmonary fiber size distribution between mesothelioma and lung cancer cases. […] These differences may be a manifestation of individual handling of mineral particles because of structural variations in individual lungs.

Thoracic tumor, especially lung cancer, ranks as the top cancer mortality in most parts of the world. […] Lung adenocarcinoma is the predominant subtype and there is increasing knowledge on therapeutic molecular targets, namely EGFR, ALK, KRAS, and ROS1, among lung cancers. […] Lung cancer cell lines established with known clinical characteristics and molecular profiling of oncogenic targets like ALK or KRAS could be useful tools for understanding the biology of known molecular targets as well as for drug testing and screening. […] Five new cancer cell lines were established from pleural fluid or biopsy tissues obtained from Chinese patients with primary lung adenocarcinomas or malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] These newly established lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma cell lines were maintained for over 100 passages and demonstrated morphological and immunohistochemical features as well as growth kinetics of tumor cell lines. […] One of these new cell lines bears EML4-ALK rearrangement variant 2, two lung cancer cell lines bear different KRAS mutations at codon 12, and known single nucleotide polymorphism variants were identified in these cell lines. […] Four new lung adenocarcinoma and one mesothelioma cell lines were established from patients with different clinical characteristics and oncogenic mutation profiles. […] These characterized cell lines and their mutation profiles will provide resources for exploration of lung cancer and mesothelioma biology with regard to the presence of known oncogenic mutations.

Globally, an estimated 107,000 people die annually from lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, and asbestosis due to occupational asbestos exposure.

[…] Asbestos causes more lung cancer deaths than malignant mesothelioma of the pleura; most cases of the latter are due to asbestos exposure. […] No safe threshold for asbestos exposure has been established for lung cancer and mesothelioma. […] Asbestos exposure without asbestosis and smoking increases the risk of lung cancer. […] Asbestos workers who cease smoking experience a dramatic drop in lung cancer risk, which approaches that of nonsmokers after 30 years.

We have conducted a population-based study of pleural mesothelioma patients with occupational histories and measured asbestos lung burdens in occupationally exposed workers and in the general population. […] The relationship between lung burden and risk, particularly at environmental exposure levels, will enable future mesothelioma rates in people born after 1965 who never installed asbestos to be predicted from their asbestos lung burdens. […] Following personal interview asbestos fibres longer than 5 µm were counted by transmission electron microscopy in lung samples obtained from 133 patients with mesothelioma and 262 patients with lung cancer. […] Lifetime mesothelioma risk is approximately 0.02% per 1000 amphibole fibres per gram of dry lung tissue over a more than 100-fold range, from 1 to 4 in the most heavily exposed building workers to less than 1 in 500 in most of the population. […] The approximate linearity of the dose-response together with lung burden measurements in younger people will provide reasonably reliable predictions of future mesothelioma rates in those born since 1965 whose risks cannot yet be seen in national rates.

[…] The relative abundance of these predetermined biomarkers among groups served to establish the differential diagnosis of: malignant versus benign (TB) effusions, lung adenocarcinoma versus mesothelioma, and lymphoma versus TB. […] For lung adenocarcinoma-mesothelioma discrimination, combining CA19-9, CA15-3, and kallikrein-12 had maximal discriminatory capacity (65% sensitivity, 100% specificity, AUC 0.94); figures which also refer to the validation set.

The cases of workers suffering from asbestos-related diseases diagnosed from 1996 to 2015 were collected on the occasion of some legal trials; the diagnosis, and the asbestos occupational and non-occupational exposure, were carefully evaluated.Lung samples were obtained from subjects, taking advantage of the autopsies; asbestos fibers were counted by means of a Scanning Electron Microscope, equipped with x-ray fluorescence microanalyses at 12.0000 amplification, and asbestos bodies by means of an Optical Microscope at 500 amplification. 192 malignant mesotheliomas (6 in women), 196 lung cancers and 14 asbestosis (without cancer) were observed (1996-2015); autopsies were carried out on 80% of all subjects and 98% of mesotheliomas were confirmed by autopsies. […] Pleural plaques occurred on 90% of mesotheliomas and 87% of lung cancers; histologically mild asbestosis were diagnosed on 28% of mesotheliomas and 48% of lung cancers. […] In malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer cases respectively, the duration of occupational exposure was on average 24 and 23 ys, the latency time 48 and 46 ys, hiring at the shipyard before 1970 24 and 23 ys. […] Out of 114 lung analysis, the burden of asbestos fibres was &gt;10 million for 33.3% of subjects and out of 99 lung analysis asbestos bodies was &gt;10.000 for 71.7%; the average time since last exposure was 31 ys.

Despite the fact that working with asbestos and placing it on the market have been banned in Germany since 1993 according to the Ordinance on Hazardous Substances, asbestos-related diseases of the lungs and pleura are still the leading cause of death in occupational diseases. […] Occupational diseases, mainly mesotheliomas and lung cancer emerging now are thus caused by asbestos exposure which occurred 30-40 years earlier. […] It is known that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure results in a superadditive increase in the risk to develop lung cancer. […] No suitable screening methods for early detection of malignant mesothelioma are currently available and the therapeutic options are still very limited; however, the national lung screening trial (NLST) has shown for the first time that by employing low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in heavy smokers, lung cancer mortality can be significantly reduced. […] These results in association with the recommendations of international medical societies and organizations were pivotal as the German statutory accident insurance (DGUV) decided to provide LDCT as a special occupational medical examination for workers previously exposed to asbestos and with a particularly high risk for developing lung cancer.

[…] Asbestos body (AB) concentrations were greater than or equal to 1900/g dry lung, and total amphibole fiber concentrations were greater than or equal to 390,000/g dry lung. […] Thus, histologic sections showing greater than or equal to 0.5 ABs/cm2 or extracts containing asbestos body or amphibole fiber concentrations of at least 1900 or 390,000/g dry lung, respectively, will confirm an asbestos-related mesothelioma.

Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) associated with carcinomatous pleuritis are currently classified as having stage IV disease per the 7<sup>th</sup> edition of the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system, which means that the disease is deemed incurable. […] In fact, the 5-year survival rate of these patients was only 2% in a large global cohort collected by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. […] Although the development of chemotherapeutic agents, including molecular targeted drugs, might have the potential to prolong the survival of patients with advanced lung cancer, surgical interventions including EPP might have a role in improving the survival of patients with carcinomatous pleuritis of minimal disease and those without massive effusion or numerous pleural nodules.

A decade after, asbestos “curious bodies” were firstly described in the lung tissue by Cooke (1926) and McDonald (1927). […] Occupational exposure to asbestos is now regulated in Romania, but past exposure is still a cause of asbestosis-related diseases (ARDs), including lung cancer. […] A peculiar association between a lung adenocarcinoma, a previously healed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) disease, is reported in a 61-year-old nonsmoker white man, a former factory worker with 29 years of occupational exposure history to cement and asbestos fibers. […] The main purpose of this case report is to describe the development of a right pleural effusion which was not revelatory for a mesothelioma but for an adenocarcinoma of the lung. […] In conclusion, unilateral paraneoplastic pleural effusion in a nonsmoker male with occupational exposure to asbestosis fibers was suggestive for adenocarcinoma related asbestosis of the lung. […] Lung cancer and malignant pleural exudate developed after a long latency cumulative retention time of asbestos fibers.

[…] We performed whole gene expression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from sarcomatoid mesothelioma and lung sarcomatoid carcinoma and observed significant differences in the expression of MUC4 and other genes between sarcomatoid mesothelioma and lung sarcomatoid carcinoma. […] Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that MUC4 was expressed in the spindled tumor cells of lung sarcomatoid carcinoma (21/29, 72%) but was not expressed in any sarcomatoid mesothelioma (0/31, 0%). […] To differentiate sarcomatoid mesothelioma from lung sarcomatoid carcinoma, negative MUC4 expression showed 100% sensitivity and 72% specificity and accuracy rate of 87%, which is higher than immunohistochemical markers such as calretinin, D2-40 and Claudin-4.

Lung cancer and pleural mesothelioma are two of the most deadly forms of cancer. […] The prognosis of lung cancer and mesothelioma is extremely poor due to limited treatment modalities and lack of understanding of the disease mechanisms. […] Mesothelin (MSLN), a plasma membrane differentiation antigen, is expressed at a high level in many human solid tumors, including 70% of lung cancer and nearly all mesotheliomas. […] MSLN plays a key role in controlling epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stem properties of human lung cancer and mesothelioma cells that control their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential. […] Firstly, MSLN was found to be highly upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient tissues and in lung carcinoma and mesothelioma cell lines. […] These results indicate an essential role of MSLN in controlling EMT and stem cell properties of human lung cancer and mesothelioma cells. […] Since EMT is an important process in tumor progression and metastasis, and MSLN is nonessential in most normal tissue, our findings on MSLN may provide new insights into the disease mechanisms and may aid in the development of novel targeted therapy for lung cancer and mesothelioma.

Malignant pleural effusions are frequent in patients with advanced stages of lung cancer and are commonly infiltrated by lymphocytes and tumor cells. […] The programmed death receptor 1(PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway is involved in T-cell exhaustion, and it might be responsible for T-cell dysfunction in lung cancer patients. […] Here, we show that PD-L1 is expressed on tumor cell samples from malignant effusions, on lung cancer cell lines, and, interestingly, on MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. […] PD-L1 was up-regulated in lung cancer cell lines upon treatment with IFN-gamma, but not under hypoxic conditions, as detected by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. […] Hence, our study provides evidence that lung cancer patients respond to immunotherapy due to blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway.

The separation of sarcomatoid and desmoplastic malignant mesotheliomas from sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung metastatic to the pleura may be difficult, since both types of tumor can be morphologically similar and are frequently positive only for pan-keratin. […] In this study we asked whether GATA3 stains could be used to distinguish sarcomatoid/desmoplastic malignant mesotheliomas (N=19) from sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung (N=13). […] All 19 sarcomatoid/desmoplastic malignant mesotheliomas examined showed strong diffuse staining for GATA3 (no case scored &lt;3, mean score±SD for all 19 cases 5.4±0.9), whereas only 2 of 13 sarcomatoid carcinomas of the lung stained positively for GATA3 and the staining was weak and patchy (score 2 for each case, mean±SD for all 13 cases 0.4±0.8). […] We conclude that strong diffuse staining for GATA3 favors a diagnosis of sarcomatoid/desmoplastic malignant mesothelioma over metastatic sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung; conversely, complete absence of GATA-3 staining is evidence against a diagnosis of sarcomatoid/desmoplastic malignant mesothelioma.

[…] Evidence to date indicates that TUSC2 behaves as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer; however, its role as a tumor suppressor for other tumor types has not been fully established.

However, studies of asbestos fibers recovered from human lungs in cases of mesothelioma indicate that, at least in large-scale samples, relatively few fibers meet this size criterion, perhaps implying that the animal data do not apply to man. […] Since asbestos concentration in lung is known to be extremely inhomogeneous, it is also possible that long fibers may selectively accumulate in specific sites, such as under the pleura. […] Whether these differences reflect differences in initial deposition of fibers within the lung, or, more likely, specific redistribution of fibers, is unclear, but in either case, accumulation of long fibers immediately under the upper lobe pleura may be important in the genesis of mesothelioma.

The methods conventionally used to determine the burden of asbestos fibres inhaled/incorporated in lung require chemical digestion of the biological matrix before counting/characterising the inorganic fibrous phases under scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). […] The filter was then examined under SEM/EDS using two methods 1. following the standardised procedure to assess the fibre burden in lung by investigating only 2 mm<sup>2</sup> of the filter (660 microscopic fields), and 2. analysing all the microscopic fields in one-quarter of the filter (about 82 mm<sup>2</sup>).

The presence of asbestos bodies (ABs) in lung parenchyma is considered a histopathologic hallmark of past exposure to asbestos fibers, of which there was a population of longer fibers. […] Genotypes/haplotypes were compared according to the number of lung ABs. […] Our findings suggest that the NLRP1 inflammasome might contribute in the development of lung ABs.

<b>Rationale:</b> Nonexpandable lung is a recognized phenomenon that can create management challenges in patients with mesothelioma. […] Its prevalence and clinical importance are unknown.<b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of nonexpandable lung and to evaluate whether there was any association between nonexpandable lung and survival in a clinical cohort of patients with mesothelioma.<b>Methods:</b> This was a prospective, observational cohort study of patients with mesothelioma who were seen in a single center between March 1, 2008, and August 3, 2017. […] Serial chest radiographs were assessed for the presence of pleural effusions and nonexpandable lung (defined as a lack of lung expansion after pleural aspiration or drainage). […] Patients were followed until they died or were censored on March 14, 2019.<b>Results:</b> Of 229 patients, 192 (82.7%) had a pleural effusion at presentation, and nonexpandable lung was observed in 64 of these 192 patients (33.3%). […] Breathlessness and cough were more frequent in patients with pleural effusions, especially in those with underlying nonexpandable lung, whereas chest pain was more prevalent in patients without effusions. […] Patients with pleural effusions, both with and without underlying nonexpandable lung, were more likely to have epithelioid or early-stage disease and to receive chemotherapy than patients with no pleural effusion. […] Nonexpandable lung was an independent risk factor for short survival, with a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.80 (95% confidence interval, 1.16-2.80) compared with patients without nonexpandable lung. […] The presence of a pleural effusion did not appear to be associated with a worse prognosis compared with patients with an effusion (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-3.72).<b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first study to describe the prevalence and clinical implications of nonexpandable lung in mesothelioma. […] It demonstrates that nonexpandable lung is a relatively common phenomenon that is associated with significant symptomatology and shorter survival.<b>Keywords:</b> mesothelioma; nonexpandable lung; pleural effusion.

<b>Background:</b> Intrapleural administration of compounds is a lung targeted, innovative therapeutic strategy for mesothelioma, which can be refined as a route for drug delivery that minimizes the potential for systemic toxicity. […] However, little is currently known about the retention of liposomal drugs at the site, after such topical administration. <b>Purpose:</b> To evaluate the retention of liposomes in lungs following intrapleural injection, and how this might be modulated by liposome properties and disease progression. <b>Methods:</b> DiR-incorporating liposomes with various lipid compositions and sizes were prepared, characterized (for size distribution and zeta potential) and injected intrapleurally in normal mice and mice with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). […] Finally, no difference was noticed in liposomal-DiR retention between tumor-inoculated (MPE) and healthy mice, indicating the stability of liposomes in the presence of effusion (in MPE mice). <b>Conclusion:</b> The current study provides novel insights for using liposomes by intrapleural administration for the treatment of lung diseases.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma usually arises from the pleural surface and progressively encases the lungs. […] We describe the case of a patient with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathies and left pleural effusion in the absence of pleural lesions, simulating advanced stage lung cancer. […] Despite its rarity, intraparenchymal malignant pleural mesothelioma should always be taken into account, when lung nodules are present, to prevent misdiagnosis and avoid delayed treatment.

Since 1963 in the All-Union Research Institute of Clinical and Experimental Surgery 1445 patients with malignant lung tumors were operated upon, in 44 patients (3%) rare tumors were observed. […] Rare malignant lung tumors (especially sarcomas, plasmocytomas, mesotheliomas) show a definite specificity of clinico-roentgenological manifestations, that should be taken into accout in establishing the differential diagnosis. […] An extent of surgical interventions in rare malignant tumors is determined by the size, type of the tumor growth and its localization, and it is largely identical to that in lung cancer.

Analysis of numbers and types of asbestos fibers present in lung tissue may provide insights into the pathogenesis of asbestos-induced disease, as well as diagnostic information concerning the relationship of a given lesion to asbestos exposure. […] This type of analysis requires extraction of fibers and asbestos bodies from lung tissue, preferably by means of a digestion-and-concentration technique, and examination with a combination of electron optical techniques, including electron diffraction and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. […] Numbers of asbestos bodies markedly underestimate total numbers of fibers present in lung. […] In patients from the general population, the mean number of asbestos fibers is about 1 X 10(6)/g dry lung; of this number, more than 80 per cent are fibers of chrysotile less than 5 microns long. […] Patients in the general population who have pleural plaques have about the same total number of fibers, but their lungs contain about a 50-fold increase in long thin amphibole fibers of commercial origin. […] Patients who have asbestosis and most patients who have mesothelioma have 100 to 200 X 10(6) fibers/g dry lung; the grade of asbestosis appears to be related to total fiber content.

[…] For comparison we also studied 66 patients with benign lung diseases and nine with pleural mesothelioma. […] CYFRA 21-1 serum levels significantly increased in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and mesothelioma, while TPA, TPS and TPM increased in patients with lung cancer irrespective of the histological type. […] An analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the highest diagnostic accuracies in distinguishing benign from malignant lung diseases were achieved with TPM (81%), CYFRA 21-1 (72%), CEA (78%) or TPA (78%) when using cut-off values of 46 Ul-1, 3.0 micrograms l-1, 2.0 micrograms l-1 and 75 Ul-1 respectively. […] However, taking into consideration the fact that CYFRA 21-1 is the most sensitive index of early lung tumours and that its combined determination with TPM did not worsen the overall sensitivity and specificity of the latter, the combined use of these two markers may be suggested as a useful took for the diagnosis of lung tumours.

As pathologists, we are most concerned about overcalling reactive changes in the lung as carcinoma and the fact that malignant processes may be misinterpreted as benign processes in the lung is less well recognized. […] Lymphoid lesions of the lung present a number of problems; small lymphocytic lymphomas and Hodgkin’s disease are often misinterpreted as inflammatory processes. […] Intravascular lymphomatosis in the lung may be misinterpreted as an interstitial pneumonia if one does not appreciate the atypical lymphoid cells within the capillaries.

Lung surfactant protein-A (SP-A) is a major phospholipid-associated glycoprotein in surfactant, and is a useful immunohistochemical marker for lung adenocarcinoma. […] We studied the value of combined determinations of CEA and SP-A in pleural fluid to distinguish between lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma. […] SP-A and CEA concentrations were measured in pleural effusions from 78 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 10 with malignant mesothelioma. […] SP-A concentrations in pleural effusions due to lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma were 516 +/- 140 and 16.9 +/- 3.6 ng.ml-1 (mean +/- SEM), respectively. […] CEA concentrations in pleural effusions due to lung adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma were 239 +/- 92.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.3 ng.ml-1, respectively. […] SP-A values did not exceed 100 ng.ml-1 in any of 10 mesotheliomas, whilst in 37 of 78 lung adenocarcinomas they did. […] CEA values did not exceed 10 ng.ml-1 in any of 10 mesotheliomas, whilst in 53 of 78 lung adenocarcinomas they did. […] Increased values of SP-A and/or CEA were found in pleural effusions from 67 of 78 lung adenocarcinomas. […] It is concluded that a combination of CEA and SP-A assays in pleural effusions will be helpful for discriminating lung adenocarcinoma from mesothelioma.

The distinction between malignant mesotheliomas and tumors of epithelial origin, particularly peripheral lung adenocarcinoma, can be difficult despite the use of immunocytochemical markers and other diagnostic tools.

[…] Thus, we postulated that N-cadherin could be used as a marker of mesothelial cells and mesothelial tumors, in contrast to adenocarcinomas of the lung that are tumors of epithelial origin. […] We studied the expression of N-cadherin, E-cadherin and two cadherin-associated proteins, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin, in 19 pleural mesotheliomas, 16 lung adenocarcinomas and in 2 mesothelioma cell lines using specific monoclonal antibodies and immunohistochemical methods.

The urokinase receptor (uPAR) influences several biological functions relevant to lung injury and repair, including proteolysis, cell migration, and adhesion. […] In this study, we sought to determine if uPAR expression in lung and pleural cells involves a similar posttranscriptional pathway. […] We first identified and characterized the uPAR mRNABP in rabbit tissues using gel mobility shift, ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking, and RNase protection assays and detected it in liver, heart, brain, spleen, colon, and lung. […] Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, lipopolysaccharide, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or cycloheximide induced uPAR and uPAR mRNA expression in cultured rabbit pleural mesothelial cells and lung fibroblasts and concurrently reduced the uPAR mRNA-uPAR mRNABP interaction. […] A uPAR mRNABP physicochemically and functionally similar to that of human malignant mesothelioma is constitutively expressed in the rabbit lung and other nonneoplastic tissues. […] In rabbit lung fibroblasts and mesothelial cells, expression of uPAR involves posttranscriptional regulation whereby the uPAR mRNABP appears to interact with a specific coding region cis-element to decrease the stability of uPAR mRNA.

In order to determine whether SV40-like DNA sequences are also present in bronchopulmonary carcinoma and non-malignant lung samples, 125 frozen pleural and pulmonary samples (including 21 mesotheliomas, 63 bronchopulmonary carcinomas, 8 other tumours, and 33 non-malignant samples) and 38 additional samples distant from tumours were studied for the occurrence of SV40-like DNA sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by hybridization with specific probes. […] In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of SV40-like DNA sequences in pulmonary neoplasms and in non-malignant lung tissues.

In the years 1978-1992, the cohort had an elevated risk for all malignant neoplasms combined (n = 153, SIR = 117, ns), lung cancer (n = 28, SIR = 135, ns), mesothelioma (n = 21; SIR &gt; 5000, p &lt; .0001), unspecified pleural cancer (n = 5; SIR = 278, P &lt; .0001), and liver cancer (n = 7, SIR 290, ns). […] The ratio of mesothelioma to excess lung cancer cases was 2.9 to 1, or 3.6 to 1, if pleural cases of unspecified origin were included; the pleura to peritoneum ratio of verified mesothelioma cases was 20 to 1. […] This atypically high ratio of mesothelioma to excess lung cancer cases is suggested to be the combined result of high past asbestos exposures in the workers and their low prior risk for lung cancer, and possibly, relatively early smoking cessation in relation to asbestos exposure.
