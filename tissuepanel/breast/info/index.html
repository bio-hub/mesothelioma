Diagnosing breast carcinoma that has metastasized to body cavity fluids can be difficult. […] However, only five cases of breast carcinoma were studied. […] We examined Glut-1 specifically as a means of detecting breast carcinoma in effusion cytology. […] Using avidin-biotin immunocytochemistry, cell block material from 31 cases of breast carcinoma metastatic to body cavity effusions and 33 cases of benign effusions were studied. […] Of the breast cancer cases, 19 of 31 (61%) were immunoreactive for Glut-1, and 25 of 31 (81%) were positive for either Glut-1 or mucicarmine. […] These data suggest that using Glut-1 as a single immunostain or in conjunction with mucicarmine is a specific but modestly sensitive means of detecting breast carcinoma in this cytologic setting.

[…] Malignant breast carcinoma effusions (46) and corresponding solid tumors (39) and 104 MM (26 effusions, 78 solid tumors) were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). […] IHC showed predominantly focal HLA-G expression in 12 of 46 (26%) breast carcinoma effusions and 16 of 39 (41%) solid lesions. […] IB showed more frequent HLA-G expression in MM compared with breast carcinoma effusions, while RT-PCR showed HLA-G mRNA expression in both tumors. […] Breast cancer patients with HLA-G-positive tumor cells had shorter disease-free survival (mean 37 vs 85, median 25 vs 31 months), though not significantly (p=0.14). […] In conclusion, HLA-G is focally expressed in MM and breast carcinoma, while HLA-ABC expression is conserved. […] However, the up-regulated expression of HLA-G in MM effusions and its possible association with shorter disease-free survival in advanced stage of breast carcinoma suggest a possible role in immune response evasion in some tumors.

In this study, we evaluated the value of immunostaining pattern for podoplanin to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinomas of various origins.Cell blocks from previously collected paraffin-embedded cell blocks of 86 effusions (18 mesothelioma, 35 reactive mesothelium, 9 breast adenocarcinoma, 14 ovarian adenocarcinoma, and 10 lung adenocarcinoma) were retrieved from the file of the Department of Pathology at University of Michigan and Lund University in Sweden and were used for the study. […] The intensity of positive results was evaluated as strong, moderate, or weak.Podoplanin is expressed in 94% of malignant mesothelioma cases (17/18), 97% (30/31) of cases of reactive mesothelial, 0% of lung adenocarcinoma cases (0/9), 0% of breast adenocarcinoma (0/9), and 7% of ovarian adenocarcinoma (1/14). […] The one positive case of ovarian adenocarcinoma showed a weak membranous podoplanin immunostaining.On the basis of our results and published data, we believe that membranous podoplanin immunoreactivity, in conjunction with calretinin, would be more specific than CK5/6 and WT-1 in differentiating epithelioid malignant mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma of the lung, breast, and ovary.

Epithelioid mesotheliomas and breast carcinomas can present a variety of morphologic patterns. […] Because of this, breast carcinomas that metastasize to the pleura and lung may be confused with mesotheliomas. […] Sixty epithelioid mesotheliomas and 80 breast carcinomas (40 triple negative and 40 estrogen receptor positive) were investigated for expression of the positive mesothelioma markers calretinin, keratin 5/6, mesothelin, podoplanin, thrombomodulin, and WT1; the positive carcinoma marker claudin 4; and the breast-associated markers gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15), mammaglobin, and GATA3. […] Of the triple-negative breast carcinomas, 100% expressed claudin 4; 5%, keratin 5/6; 30%, GATA3; 18%, mammaglobin; 15%, GCDFP-15; 56%, mesothelin; 38%, calretinin; 18%, thrombomodulin; 5%, WT1; and 3%, podoplanin. […] Among the estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas, 100% were claudin 4 and GATA3 positive; 70% expressed GCDFP-15; 63%, mammaglobin; 13%, calretinin; 13%, thrombomodulin; 8%, WT1; 5%, keratin 5/6; 3%, mesothelin; and 0%, podoplanin. […] It is concluded that podoplanin and WT1 are the best positive mesothelioma markers for differentiating epithelioid mesotheliomas from breast carcinomas. […] An accurate differential diagnosis can be reached with the use of these two markers in combination with the breast-associated markers GCDFP-15, mammaglobin, and GATA3.

[…] Of the metastatic breast carcinomas, immunohistostaining of AR, GATA3, ER, PgR, mammaglobin, GCDFP-15 were positive in 27 cases (81.8%), 24 cases (72.7%), 26 cases (78.8%), 13 cases (39.4%), 12 cases (36.4%), 9 cases (27.3%), respectively.

A panel of 13 mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and 1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was tested for reactivity with tumor cells in 26 effusions obtained from patients with carcinoma of ovary, breast, or mesothelioma, using an immunoperoxidase staining reaction. […] One of the mAb in our panel (2G3) was consistently shown to produce strong staining of a high proportion of tumor cells in effusions and tumor nodules from patients with ovarian or breast cancer and may be of value in immunocytochemical diagnosis and therapy of epithelial malignancies.

The objective of this study was to analyze the expression level and clinical role of soluble AXL (sAXL) in cancers affecting the serosal surfaces, with focus on ovarian carcinoma. sAXL protein expression by ELISA was analyzed in 572 effusion supernatants, including 424 peritoneal, 147 pleural and 1 pericardial specimens. sAXL was overexpressed in peritoneal effusions compared to pleural and pericardial specimens (p &lt; 0.001). sAXL levels were additionally significantly higher in effusions from patients with ovarian carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma and breast carcinoma compared to specimens from patients with other cancers (predominantly carcinomas of lung, gastrointestinal or uterine corpus/cervix origin) or benign reactive effusions (p &lt; 0.001). sAXL was further overexpressed in high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC; n = 373) compared to low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC; n = 32; p = 0.036). […] Levels were similarly unrelated to survival in LGSC and breast carcinoma. sAXL is widely expressed in malignant effusions, particularly in ovarian and breast carcinoma and in malignant mesothelioma. sAXL is overexpressed in HGSC compared to LGSC and its levels are lower following exposure to chemotherapy.
