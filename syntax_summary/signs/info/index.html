Pseudomesotheliomatous carcinoma is a rare variant of peripheral adenocarcinoma of the lung that can manifest clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features similar to malignant mesothelioma. […] The clinical, radiologic, and gross and routine histologic findings were similar to those of a malignant mesothelioma; the final diagnosis could be made based mainly on immunocytochemical results.

One of the primary limitations of adenoviral (Ad) -mediated gene therapy is the generation of anti-Ad inflammatory responses that can induce clinical toxicity and impair gene transfer efficacy. […] In a previous phase I clinical trial, we demonstrated that Ad-mediated intrapleural delivery of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSVtk) to patients with mesothelioma resulted in significant, but relatively superficial, HSVtk gene transfer and marked anti-Ad humoral and cellular immune responses. […] When a similar group of patients was treated with Ad.HSVtk and a brief course of corticosteroids, decreased clinical inflammatory responses were seen, but there was no demonstrable inhibition of anti -Ad antibody production or Ad-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation. […] Although limited by the small numbers of patients studied, our data suggest that systemic administration of steroids in the context of Ad-based gene delivery may limit acute clinical toxicity, but may not inhibit cellular and humoral responses to Ad vectors.

Most studies also do not separate out the failure patterns based on the initial stage (clinical or pathologic) of the disease.

[…] Kestenholz et al currently are performing a phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant cisplatin and gemcitabine administered for three cycles followed by EPP and adjuvant radiation therapy. […] A similar approach also is being pursued in an ongoing clinical trial using neoadjuvant cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles before EPP followed by 54 Gy of adjuvant hemithorax radiation. […] Further clinical studies are needed for all patients with mesothelioma to define the optimum surgery and duration and types of adjuvant therapy.

Because serosal surfaces are a common site of metastatic spread for a variety of malignant neoplasms originating from internal organs, separating malignant mesothelioma from metastatic tumors is of clinical importance. […] The diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is complex and usually requires a multimodal approach that includes careful clinical history and physical examination, imaging studies, and tissue sampling for multimodal evaluation including routine histology, histochemistry, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical tests. […] Additionally, the selection and utility of these various markers can vary considerably based on a constellation of circumstances, including patient sex, histologic appearance of the tumor (ie, epithelioid vs. sarcomatoid, etc), and various other clinical circumstances. […] Herein, we will review the currently available immunohistochemical markers used for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma and offer suggestions for the use of appropriate panels of stains based on specific morphologic types and clinical circumstances.

The clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features of 10 cases of pleural malignant mesothelioma with predominantly adenomatoid growth pattern are described to determine the clinical, histologic, and behavioral features of these tumors and to highlight the importance of separating this unusual pattern from the benign adenomatoid tumor. […] The main presenting symptoms included cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. […] Clinical follow-up in 7 of 7 patients demonstrated a mean survival of 10 months from time of diagnosis. […] The clinical presentation, infiltrative growth, distinct histologic features, cytologic atypia and immunohistochemical profile all serve to differentiate adenomatoid malignant mesothelioma from other infiltrative processes involving the pleura.

Preclinical studies targeting the genetic abnormality with adenoviruses showed that restoration of the p53 pathways induced pRb dephosphorylation and subsequently produced anti-tumor effects. […] A number of preclinical studies with different genes and vector systems demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy and raised the possibility of gene therapy in clinical settings. […] There have been several clinical studies conducted for mesothelioma and these trials showed the feasibility of intrapleural administrations of adenovirus vectors. […] In this review we summarize major preclinical and clinical gene therapy for mesothelioma, and discuss the advantages of gene therapy in the context of stimulating host immune systems. […] Accumulating clinical data suggest that an intrapleural administration of viral vectors has distinct aspects which are not observed in other administration routes.

[…] It is recommended that at least 2 mesothelial and 2 carcinoma markers with greater than 80% sensitivity and specificity be used for the diagnosis of mesothelioma when all clinical, radiologic, and histologic features are concordant. p16 deletion is reported in up to 70% of primary epithelioid and 90% to 100% of sarcomatoid pleural mesotheliomas. […] The impact of various histologic patterns on the clinical and prognostic aspects of mesothelioma is addressed. […] Recent studies have shown that the high-grade subgroup of deciduoid mesothelioma with pleomorphic histologic pattern also has a more aggressive clinical course.

<td style="text-align:center;">
Preclinical and clinical studies exploring the efficacy of drugs targeting tyrosine kinases, angiogenesis and histone deacetylases, did not fulfil the expected clinical benefits. […] CSCs are putative driving factors for MPM development and contribute to its clinical and biological heterogeneity; hence, targeted eradication of CSCs represents an ineludible goal to counteract MPM aggressiveness. […] In this context, innovative preclinical models could be exploited to identify novel intracellular pathway inhibitors able to target CSC viability. […] In this review we describe current knowledge of MPM cell biology, focusing on potential targets to be tested in pharmacological studies, and highlighting results and challenges of clinical translation.

[…] Six North American institutions electronically submitted clinical, pathologic, and imaging data on patients with stages I to IV MPM to an established multicenter database and biostatistical center. […] Two reference radiologists blinded to clinical data independently reviewed the scans; calculated clinical T, node, and metastasis stage by standard criteria; performed semiautomated tumor volume calculations using commercially available software; and submitted the findings to the biostatistical center. […] Discordant clinical staging of most cases confirmed the inadequacy of current criteria.

It has become well established that restoring miRNA levels can inhibit tumor growth, and many studies have demonstrated this in preclinical models. […] This in turn has led to the first clinical trials of miRNA replacement therapy. […] This special report focuses on the development of TargomiRs - miRNA mimics delivered by targeted bacterial minicells - and the very first clinical experience of a miRNA replacement therapy in thoracic cancer patients in the Phase I MesomiR-1 trial.

[…] In our series, exposure to asbestos, smoking history, localization of the lesion, pleural effusion and histologic type have no influence on the median survival from symptoms. […] However, the median survival from symptoms was significantly shorter in males, subjects more than 49 years of age, those having symptoms less than 6 months, those with a negative tuberculin skin test, or those with metastasis of the tumor compared with females, subjects less than 50 years of age, those having symptoms more than 6 months, those with a positive tuberculin skin test, or those without metastasis of the tumor, respectively.

Detailed guidelines regarding the use of radiation therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) are currently lacking because of the rarity of the disease, the wide spectrum of clinical presentations, and the paucity of high-level data on individual treatment approaches. […] Here we present consensus recommendations on the use of radiation therapy for MPM in three discrete scenarios: (1) hemithoracic radiation therapy to be used before or after extrapleural pneumonectomy; (2) hemithoracic radiation to be used as an adjuvant to lung-sparing procedures (i.e., without pneumonectomy); and (3) palliative radiation therapy for focal symptoms caused by the disease. […] The recommendations provided in this consensus statement should serve as important guidelines for developing future clinical trials of treatment approaches for MPM.

Recommendations include: (1) classification should be updated to include architectural patterns and stromal and cytologic features that refine prognostication; (2) subject to data accrual, malignant mesothelioma in situ could be an additional category; (3) grading of epithelioid malignant pleural mesotheliomas should be routinely undertaken; (4) favorable/unfavorable histologic characteristics should be routinely reported; (5) clinically relevant molecular data (programmed death ligand 1, BRCA 1 associated protein 1 [BAP1], and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) should be incorporated into reports, if undertaken; (6) other molecular data should be accrued as part of future trials; (7) resection specimens (i.e., extended pleurectomy/decortication and extrapleural pneumonectomy) should be pathologically staged with smaller specimens being clinically staged; (8) ideally, at least three separate areas should be sampled from the pleural cavity, including areas of interest identified on pre-surgical imaging; (9) image-acquisition protocols/imaging terminology should be standardized to aid research/refine clinical staging; (10) multidisciplinary tumor boards should include pathologists to ensure appropriate treatment options are considered; (11) all histologic subtypes should be considered potential candidates for chemotherapy; (12) patients with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesothelioma should not be excluded from first-line clinical trials unless there is a compelling reason; (13) tumor subtyping should be further assessed in relation to duration of response to immunotherapy; and (14) systematic screening of all patients for germline mutations is not recommended, in the absence of a family history suspicious for BAP1 syndrome.

Recently, clinical trials that used immunotherapy strategies have yielded promising results, but the benefits are restricted to a limited number of patients. […] To develop new therapeutic strategies and define predictors of treatment response to existing therapy, better knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of MM tumors and sound preclinical models are needed. […] Classical preclinical models are based on use of MM cell lines in culture or implanted in rodents, i.e., xenografts in immunosuppressed mice or isografts in syngeneic rodents to assess the anti-tumor immune response. […] Even if preclinical models have allowed for major advances, they show several limitations: (i) the anatomical and biological tumor microenvironments are incompletely reproduced; (ii) the intra-tumor heterogeneity and immunological contexts are not fully reconstructed; and (iii) the inter-tumor heterogeneity is insufficiently considered. […] Given that these limitations vary according to the models, preclinical models must be carefully selected depending on the objectives of the experiments.

Brachytherapy techniques can be tailored to the clinical situation and can be in the form of permanent interstitial volume or planar implants (radioactive sources permanently imbedded into the tumor or tumor bed) or in the form of temporary interstitial or endoluminal implants (where radioactive sources irradiate a tumor bed over a certain length of time and then are removed).
