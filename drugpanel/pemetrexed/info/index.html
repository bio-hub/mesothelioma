Recently two antifolate-based combinations with apparently higher efficacy than older regimens have emerged: the pemetrexed/cisplatin regimen and the raltitrexed/oxaliplatin regimen. […] In two phase I trials with pemetrexed combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin responses occurred in five of 11 and nine of 29 patients, respectively. […] The first study was a multicenter, multinational trial sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, which randomized more than 430 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma to cisplatin with or without pemetrexed.

Recently, a renewed interest in MPM led to clinical trials with promising preliminary results for several agents alone or in combination, including gemcitabine, raltitrexed, vinorelbine, and pemetrexed. […] Pemetrexed, a folate-based inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and other enzymes, is currently under investigation in multiple malignancies. […] A phase I study of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin showed a remarkable response rate of approximately 50% in patients with the epithelial subtype of MPM. […] This led to a large international study of the combination of pemetrexed plus cisplatin.

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pemetrexed and carboplatin given in combination, to derive a recommended dose for phase II studies, and to explore its efficacy. […] Doses ranged from pemetrexed 400 mg/m(2) (as a 10-minute intravenous infusion), followed by carboplatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 4 mg/mL.min (as a 30-minute intravenous infusion) to pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2), carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL.min. […] The MTD was pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2), carboplatin AUC 6, because three of the five patients treated at this dose level experienced a dose-limiting toxicity. […] The MTD was pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL.min. […] The recommended phase II dose of the combination is pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL.min.

This phase II clinical study evaluated the efficacy of pemetrexed for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Patients with a histologically proven diagnosis of MPM, chemotherapy-naive measurable lesions, and adequate organ function received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) intravenously over 10 minutes every 3 weeks. […] Single-agent pemetrexed for MPM resulted in a moderate response rate (14.1%) and median overall survival of 10.7 months. […] These results indicate that patients with MPM could benefit from single-agent pemetrexed treatment combined with vitamin supplementation.

Pemetrexed (Alimta); Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN, USA) is a unique multitargeted antifolate that inhibits at least three enzymes, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. […] Similar trends were also initially observed with pemetrexed as well, but investigators later showed that these toxicities could be minimised with folic acid and vitamin B(12) supplementation included in the treatment regimen. […] Here, the current data for pemetrexed in treating thoracic malignancies are reviewed, with special focus on malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer.

The novel antifolates pemetrexed and raltitrexed are promising agents and undergoing 3 phase III studies. […] One of these studies is the largest trial ever conducted in MPM patients, which randomized 456 patients into cisplatin with or without pemetrexed groups. […] The median survival time was 12.1 months in the cisplatin with pemetrexed arm and 9.3 months in the cisplatin alone arm (p = 0.02).

We conducted a phase III trial to determine whether treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin results in survival time superior to that achieved with cisplatin alone. […] Chemotherapy-naive patients who were not eligible for curative surgery were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1, or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1. […] A total of 456 patients were assigned: 226 received pemetrexed and cisplatin, 222 received cisplatin alone, and eight never received therapy. […] Median survival time in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm was 12.1 months versus 9.3 months in the control arm (P =.020, two-sided log-rank test). […] The hazard ratio for death of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus those in the control arm was 0.77. […] Median time to progression was significantly longer in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm: 5.7 months versus 3.9 months (P =.001). […] Response rates were 41.3% in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm versus 16.7% in the control arm (P &lt;.0001). […] After 117 patients had enrolled, folic acid and vitamin B12 were added to reduce toxicity, resulting in a significant reduction in toxicities in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm. […] Treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and vitamin supplementation resulted in superior survival time, time to progression, and response rates compared with treatment with cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Pemetrexed (Alimta; Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN), a folate-based inhibitor of thymidylate synthase., is currently under phase III investigation. […] The Evaluation of Mesothelioma in a Phase III Trail of Pemetrexed with Cisplatin (EMPHACIS) trial is the first phase III randomized study in mesothelioma with survival as the primary end point; it showed statistically significant superiority of the pemetrexed/cisplatin combination over cisplatin low-dose folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation significantly reduced the toxicity observed with the use of pemetrexed/cisplatin will soon be recommended for malignant pleural mesothelioma as first-line standard chemotherapy.

Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and other folate-dependent enzymes that has emerged as one of the most active agents in this disease. […] Several phase I/II trials of pemetrexed as a single agent or in combination with a platinum drug have demonstrated considerable activity in mesothelioma. […] In a recently published phase III randomized study, pemetrexed/cisplatin showed a significant improvement in survival, response rate, and quality of life compared with single-agent cisplatin. […] In addition, several trials reported that folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation significantly reduced the toxicity observed with the use of pemetrexed without affecting the efficacy of the drug.

Pemetrexed (Alimta, Eli Lilly) is a multitargeted antifolate that inhibits at least three enzymes in the nucleic acid synthetic pathways. […] The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved pemetrexed, in combination with cisplatin, for the first-line treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Moreover, pemetrexed was recently shown to be as efficacious as docetaxel (Taxotere, Aventis) in the second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and its toxicity profile was preferable. […] The main toxicity seen with pemetrexed is myelosuppression, which is considerably reduced by coadministration of folic acid and vitamin B12. […] Multiple Phase II clinical trials have demonstrated that pemetrexed has promising single-agent activity in many other solid tumors, including head and neck, breast and colorectal cancers. […] Combination regimens consisting of pemetrexed and other chemotherapeutics or novel molecular-targeted agents are currently under investigation. […] Future studies will better define and likely expand the role of pemetrexed for the treatment of cancer.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved pemetrexed in February 2004 for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) in combination with cisplatin in patients with unresectable disease or for whom curative surgery is not an option. […] Pemetrexed is the first agent approved for the treatment of MPM. […] In August 2004, pemetrexed was approved as a second-line, single-agent treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). […] The goals of this article were to summarize the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of pemetrexed, and to review its current and potential roles in therapy for MPM, NSCLC, and other oncologic conditions. […] Search terms included pemetrexed, Alimta, MTA, multitargeted antifolate, LY231514, mesothelioma, MPM, non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. […] Myelosuppression was the predominant dose-limiting toxicity of pemetrexed reported in Phase I studies. […] Identification of the correlation between poor folate status and increased pemetrexed toxicity in a multivariate analysis led to the requirement of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation for patients in all pemetrexed studies, with a resulting noted decrease in pemetrexed toxicity. […] A single, multicenter, randomized Phase III trial compared the efficacy of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone in the treatment of MPM. […] Response rates were 41.3% in the pemetrexed/cisplatin combination and 16.7% with single-agent cisplatin (P &lt; 0.001). […] The median survival time for the pemetrexed/cisplatin combination was significantly longer at 12.1 months versus 9.3 months for cisplatin alone (P = 0.02). […] One international, multicenter, randomized Phase III trial in patients with NSCLC compared single-agent pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients previously treated with chemotherapy. […] Overall response rates (9.1% and 8.8%) and median survival (8.3 months and 7.9 months) did not differ between pemetrexed and docetaxel (P = 0.105 and P = 0.226, respectively). […] Hematologic adverse effects-grade 3/4 neutropenia (40.2% vs 5.3%; P &lt; 0.001), febrile neutropenia (12.7% vs 1.9%; P &lt; 0.001), and neutropenic infections (3.3% vs 0%; P = 0.004)-were significantly greater in the docetaxel-treated patients than in the pemetrexed-treated patients, as was alopecia (37.7% vs 6.4%; P &lt; 0.001). […] Results of an international, multicenter Phase III trial of pemetrexed in combination with gemcitabine conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer indicate that the combination is no more efficacious than single-agent gemcitabine.

Pemetrexed (Alimta, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN) is a structurally novel anti-folate agent. […] The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved pemetrexed for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. […] In the phase III trials that led to its approval, rash was reported in 17 and 22% of patients receiving pemetrexed alone or in combination with cisplatin. […] In an attempt to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about this new agent, we describe a case in which a patient developed a rash secondary to urticarial vasculitis associated with pemetrexed.

Alimta (pemetrexed) is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits several enzymes in the de novo pathways of pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis, including thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. […] Pemetrexed possesses antitumor activity in several solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, pancreas, colorectal, gastric, bladder, breast, and head and neck cancers. […] Supplementation with vitamin B(12) and folic acid greatly reduces most severe toxicities and has been implemented in pemetrexed trials since December 1999. […] Pemetrexed has been tested in five phase II trials in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. […] Some studies have suggested that a correlation exists between thymidylate synthase tumor expression with pemetrexed antitumor activity; this attractive hypothesis should be confirmed in further studies. […] A randomized phase II study comparing pemetrexed 600 and 900 mg/m(2) with vitamin supplementation as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer is ongoing.

[…] This is based on the result of a phase III trial comparing cisplatin and pemetrexed to cisplatin alone, with a significant improvement of median survival in the doublet arm (11.4 versus 8.8 months, p = 0.048). […] In non small cell lung cancer, pemetrexed has been compared as second line chemotherapy to docetaxel : efficacy was comparable (median survival of 8.3 months with pemetrexed and 7.9 months with docetaxel) but significant less hematological toxicity was observed in the pemetrexed arm compared to the docetaxel arm, especially grade 3-4 neutropenia (respectively 5.3 and 40.2%) and febrile neutropenia (1.9 versus 12.7%). […] The place of pemetrexed in elderly patients is under evaluation.

The pemetrexed disodium (Alimta), LY231514) is the first antifolate able to inhibit at the same time the synthesis of purins and pyrimidins. […] The two randomized studies carried out in the malignant pleural mesothelioma and the non small cell lung cancer made it possible to establish its utility and to record the pemetrexed in these clinical situations.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported to be an ideal therapeutic target, and a multitargeted antifolate, pemetrexed, has been clinically used for the treatment of MPM. […] We examined the therapeutic efficacy of the antihuman VEGF neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab, in combination with pemetrexed against two different human MPM cells, EHMES-10 and MSTO-211H, orthotopically inoculated into severe combined immunodeficient mice. […] Moreover, treatment with bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed more effectively suppressed the formation of the pleural effusion and prolonged the survival compared with the control and monotherapy in the EHMES-10 cell-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice. […] These results suggest that the combined use of bevacizumab and pemetrexed may therefore be promising for controlling the progression of MPM highly expressing VEGF.

[…] Pemetrexed is approved in the United States and a number of European Union countries for use in the treatment of mesothelioma, and the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. […] However, in Japan, pemetrexed was approved for use only in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of mesothelioma in January 2007. […] This approval was granted on the basis of a phase III trial of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Treatment with pemetrexed plus cisplatin and vitamin supplementation, resulted in superior survival time, time to progression, and response rates compared with treatment with cisplatin alone. […] In addition, in a phase III trial of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy, treatment with pemetrexed resulted in clinically equivalent efficacy outcomes, but with significantly fewer side effects including grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , neutropenic fever, and alopecia, compared with docetaxel. […] Therefore, pemetrexed should be considered a standard treatment option for second-line NSCLC in US and most of EU.

[…] While intravenous and intrapleural administration of pemetrexed yielded similar AUC and CL, the intrapleural route yielded a significantly lower C(max). […] As Cmax is a determinant of pemetrexed toxicity, intrapleural administration might offer a means of widening the effective therapeutic index of the drug by improving tolerability.

Pemetrexed is an antitumor agent traditionally used as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as well as in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemonaïve patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Recently, pemetrexed has been approved in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology. […] We detailed pemetrexed studies in the first-line setting of NSCLC treatment, in monotherapy, in combination with platinum and also, with other agents.

Pemetrexed, a third-generation antifolate already indicated in combination with cisplatin for the systemic treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and, as a single agent, for the second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer was in 2008 granted approval for histologically based first-line treatment by both the EMEA and FDA. […] Thymidylate synthase, the main molecular target of pemetrexed, has higher mRNA and protein expression in squamous- and small-cell lung cancer compared with adenocarcinoma. […] This differential expression might well molecularly explain the differential clinical activity of pemetrexed in the various histotypes of lung cancer, including the marginal activity in small-cell lung cancer.

[…] The next step was to test pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, as first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC patients, in a phase III, non-inferiority, randomized trial. […] This trial reported the pemetrexed plus cisplatin regimen to be not inferior, in terms of activity and efficacy, to the control arm but statistically better tolerated. […] The role of pemetrexed as maintenance therapy after first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC is currently being evaluated into a phase III trial. […] The consistency of the results of these recent studies has identified a predictive effect of NSCLC non-squamous histology for pemetrexed. […] To date, pemetrexed is registered, at the dose of 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week schedule, in combination with cisplatin, for first-line therapy and, as single-agent, for second-line treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC.This review shows the latest and indicates the future developments of pemetrexed in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients.

Pemetrexed is established as first-line treatment with cisplatin for malignant pleural mesothelioma and advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and as single-agent second-line treatment for nonsquamous NSCLC. […] Because the structure and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are similar to those of methotrexate, and methotrexate is associated with severe toxicity in patients with third-space fluid (TSF), the safety of pemetrexed in patients with TSF was evaluated. […] Patients with TSF (pleural effusions, ascites) and relapsed, stage III/IV NSCLC or malignant pleural/peritoneal mesothelioma were treated with pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. […] Plasma samples were collected during cycles 1 and 2 to compare pemetrexed concentrations with reference data from patients without TSF. […] Thirty-one patients with TSF received 123 pemetrexed doses (median, 4 cycles per patient; range, 1-11; mean dose intensity, 97.5%). […] Pemetrexed plasma concentrations were within the range of those in patients without TSF. […] Pemetrexed clearance and central volume of distribution were not statistically different between patients with and without TSF. […] No clinically relevant alterations of pemetrexed pharmacokinetics occurred in patients with TSF. […] Pemetrexed was well tolerated; toxicities were expected and manageable.

[…] We observed a synergistic antitumor effect of Treg blockade combined with pemetrexed resulting in prolonged survival. […] The combination of Treg blockade and pemetrexed was associated with decreased tumor-infiltrating Tregs, increased IL-2 production, dendritic cell maturation, and increased CD3(+)CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) tumor-infiltrating T cells when compared with mice treated with pemetrexed alone or Treg blockade alone.

Pemetrexed is a clinically available anti-folate therapeutic agent used in combination with cisplatin for the management of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and advanced non-small cell lung cancer. […] Pemetrexed inhibits three enzymes in purine and pyrimidine synthesis necessary for precursor DNA nucleotides which in turn disrupts growth and survival of normal and cancer cells. […] The mechanism by which pemetrexed induces apoptosis remains largely uncharacterised. […] In the current study, we examined the downstream effect of pemetrexed in inducing apoptosis in lung cancer cells. […] We showed that pemetrexed induced apoptosis via up-regulation of Death Receptor 5 (DR5), an important death receptor for tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). […] In addition, we discovered a synergistic effect of combination pemetrexed and recombinant TRAIL in inducing apoptosis. […] Modulating DR5 induction by small interfering RNA abrogated the ability of pemetrexed to induce apoptosis. […] In addition, silencing of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression reduced DR5 expression, demonstrating that the transcriptional factor CHOP has a pivotal role on DR5 up-regulation following pemetrexed treatment. […] In addition, enforced expression of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a known inhibitor of caspase 8, protected neoplastic cells from apoptosis despite pemetrexed and/or TRAIL therapy. […] Thus, our findings demonstrate the efficacy and mechanistic underpinnings of pemetrexed-induced apoptosis, and they suggest pemetrexed may have clinical utility when used in combination with TRAIL for the management of patients with lung cancer.

[…] Vandetanib emerged as the compound with the most potent cytotoxic activity, which interacted synergistically with carboplatin and pemetrexed. […] Moreover, pemetrexed decreased Akt phosphorylation and expression of DNA repair genes. […] Finally, most MPM samples displayed detectable levels of EGFR and TS, the variability of which could be used for patients’ stratification in future trials with vandetanib-pemetrexed-carboplatin combination. […] Vandetanib markedly enhances pemetrexed-carboplatin activity against human MPM cells.

We evaluated the antitumor effect of SOCS-1 gene delivery combined with cisplatin plus pemetrexed by cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion assay. […] Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibition of tumor growth by SOCS-1 gene delivery combined with cisplatin plus pemetrexed in vivo. […] SOCS-1 gene delivery cooperated with cisplatin plus pemetrexed to inhibit cell proliferation, invasiveness and induction of apoptosis in MPM cells. […] Furthermore, SOCS-1 gene delivery cooperated with cisplatin plus pemetrexed to regulate NF-κB signaling and significantly inhibit tumor growth of MPM in vivo. […] These results suggest that SOCS-1 gene delivery has a potent antitumor effect against MPM and a potential for clinical use in combination with cisplatin plus pemetrexed.

Although cisplatin and pemetrexed are key drugs in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, their drug-drug interactions, cross-resistance and resistance mechanisms in malignant pleural mesothelioma are not well understood. […] As a consequence, cisplatin and pemetrexed had synergistic effects in 3 cell lines and an additive effect in the fourth cell line. […] The former 3 cell lines showed similar pemetrexed sensitivity in the parental cells and their cisplatin-resistant sublines, whereas the fourth cell line exhibited cross-resistance. […] In contrast, cisplatin had diverse effects on pemetrexed-resistant sublines. […] High thymidylate synthase expression did not correlate with natural pemetrexed resistance. […] Elevated thymidylate synthase expression correlated with acquired pemetrexed resistance in 2 sublines. […] In conclusion, cisplatin and pemetrexed showed synergistic activity and no cross-resistance in 3 of the 4 malignant pleural mesothelioma cell lines, suggesting the clinical relevance of their combination in chemotherapy. […] Thymidylate synthase expression did not necessarily correlate with pemetrexed resistance.

Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy represents the standard of care in first-line treatment of advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] Pemetrexed inhibits multiple enzymes involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis, but the main target is thymidylate synthase (TS). […] After cellular uptake pemetrexed is converted into more effective polyglutamated forms by folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). […] We hypothesized that FPGS and TS protein expressions are associated with clinical outcome after pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. […] Pretreatment tumor samples from 84 patients with histologically confirmed MPM, who received pemetrexed combined with platinum (79 of 84) or single-agent pemetrexed (5 of 84) as first-line treatment, were retrospectively analyzed. […] In addition, high TS protein expression was associated with progressive disease under pemetrexed-based therapy (p = 0.0383), and shorter OS (pCOX = 0.0071), but no association with PFS was observed.

Pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite, combined with cisplatin is used as a first-line therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). […] Pemetrexed arrests cell cycle by inhibiting three enzymes in purine and pyrimidine synthesis that are necessary for DNA synthesis. […] Pemetrexed also promotes apoptosis in target cells, but little is known about its mechanism in cancer cells. […] We have previously shown that pemetrexed can result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and it can lead to downstream apoptosis. […] Our data show that pemetrexed increases Noxa expression through activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) upregulation. […] Furthermore, pemetrexed induces apoptosis by activating the Noxa-Usp9x-Mcl-1 pathway. […] Moreover, downregulation of the deubiquitinase Usp9x by pemetrexed results in downstream reduction of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression. […] Thus, our findings demonstrate that Noxa-Usp9x-Mcl-1 axis may contribute to pemetrexed-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.

To identify a possible new treatment modality for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), we examined whether combination treatment consisting of pemetrexed chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using the photosensitizer NPe6, enhanced the antitumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo models. […] Four human malignant mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO‑211H, H2052, H2452 and H28) were assayed using the WST assay after treatment with pemetrexed and NPe6‑PDT. […] Pemetrexed pre‑treatment enhanced the lethal effect of NPe6‑PDT in the four malignant mesothelioma cell lines, but NPe6‑PDT followed by pemetrexed treatment did not enhance cell lethality in the in vitro assay. […] Pemetrexed pre‑treatment did not enhance the intracellular accumulation of NPe6, which is one of the determinants of the antitumor effect of PDT. […] In nude mice injected with MSTO‑211H cells and then treated using a combination of pemetrexed and NPe6‑PDT (10 mg/kg NPe6, 10 J/cm(2) laser irradiation), the tumor volume decreased by 50% but subsequently increased, reaching the pre‑treatment value after 14 days. […] Pemetrexed treatment followed by NPe6‑PDT resulted in an 80% reduction in the tumor size and inhibited re‑growth. […] NPe6‑PDT followed by pemetrexed treatment resulted in a 60% reduction in tumor size but did not inhibit re‑growth. […] NPe6‑PDT induced the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS), which confers resistance to pemetrexed, and NPe6‑PDT followed by pemetrexed treatment did not enhance the treatment outcome in vivo.

Pemetrexed is an antifolate agent which has been used for treating malignant pleural mesothelioma and non small lung cancer in the clinic as a chemotherapeutic agent. […] In this study, pemetrexed inhibited cell growth and induced G1 phase arrest in the A549 cell line. […] To explore the molecular mechanisms of pemetrexed involved in cell growth, we used a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) proteomics approach to analyze proteins changed in A549 cells treated with pemetrexed. […] As a result, twenty differentially expressed proteins were identified by ESI-Q-TOF MS/MS analysis in A549 cells incubated with pemetrexed compared with non-treated A549 cells. […] Three key proteins (GAPDH, HSPB1 and EIF4E) changed in pemetrexed treated A549 cells were validated by Western blotting. […] Expression of p-Akt in A549 cells treated with pemetrexed was reduced. […] Thus, pemetrexed induced apoptosis in A549 cells through inhibiting the Akt pathway.

Pemetrexed, a chemotherapeutic drug, is highly active in non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Pemetrexed, an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), is used worldwide for MPM as a first-line chemotherapy regimen. […] S-1, a highly effective dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)-inhibitory fluoropyrimidine, mainly acts via a TS inhibitory mechanism similar to pemetrexed. […] We experienced one remarkable case of highly effective S-1 combined therapy for pemetrexed refractory MPM. […] Although pemetrexed is mainly used for MPM chemotherapy as a TS inhibitor, S-1 has potential as an anticancer drug not only as a TS inhibitor but also inhibiting RNA synthesis through the OPRT pathway.

[…] Supplementation with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid greatly reduces most severe toxicities and has been implemented in pemetrexed trials since December 1999. […] Pemetrexed has been tested in five phase II trials in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Thymidylate synthase (TS) has a predictive role in pemetrexed treatment of mesothelioma; however, additional chemoresistance mechanisms are poorly understood. […] PCFT, RFC and TS RNA and PCFT protein levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR of frozen tissues and immunohistochemistry of tissue-microarrays, respectively, in two cohorts of pemetrexed-treated patients. […] The contribution of PCFT expression and PCFT-promoter methylation to pemetrexed activity were evaluated in mesothelioma cells and spheroids, through 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine-mediated demethylation and siRNA-knockdown. […] Pemetrexed-treated patients with low PCFT had significantly lower rates of disease control, and shorter overall survival (OS), in both the test (N = 73, 11.3 versus 20.1 months, P = 0.01) and validation (N = 51, 12.6 versus 30.3 months, P = 0.02) cohorts. […] Patients with both low-PCFT and high-TS levels had the worst prognosis (OS, 5.5 months), whereas associations were neither found for RFC nor in pemetrexed-untreated patients. […] PCFT silencing reduced pemetrexed sensitivity, whereas 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine overcame resistance.

For pemetrexed, among the best PCFT substrates, transport by PCFT establishes its importance as a clinically important transporter in malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer. […] In recent years, the notion of PCFT-targeting has been extended to a new generation of tumor-targeted 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds that are structurally and functionally distinct from pemetrexed, and that exhibit near exclusive transport by PCFT and potent inhibition of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis.
