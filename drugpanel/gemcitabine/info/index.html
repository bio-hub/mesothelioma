We report about a patient with locally advanced, unresectable pleural mesothelioma treated with the nucleoside analog gemcitabine (2,2-difluorodeoxycytidine). […] A 54-year-old male patient with unresectable pleural mesothelioma confirmed by thoracoscopic biopsy was treated with seven cycles of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on day 1, 8 and 15) over a period of 36 weeks. […] Gemcitabine seems to be an active drug for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma. […] Because of these characteristics gemcitabine seems a suitable antineoplastic substance, especially in palliative settings.

Gemcitabine has shown activity in patients with less chemosensitive solid tumors. […] Twenty-seven chemotherapy-naive patients with histologically proven malignant mesothelioma were treated with gemcitabine as a 30-minute intravenous administration of 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. […] One case of hemolytic-uremic syndrome, most likely related to gemcitabine use, was observed. […] At the prescribed dosage and schedule, single agent gemcitabine appears to have limited activity in chemotherapy-naive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

We performed a phase II study of combined cisplatin 100 mg/m2, given intravenously on day 1, and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2, given intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle for six cycles among patients with advanced measurable pleural mesothelioma. […] Ninety-four cycles were given (median, six; mean, 4.5 per patient), with a mean relative dose intensity of cisplatin 96.7% and gemcitabine 82.5%. […] Combined cisplatin and gemcitabine is an active combination in malignant mesothelioma and produces symptomatic benefit in responding patients.

However, a recent single institution study showed an impressive activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin. […] Our aim is to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of a gemcitabine and cisplatin combination in selected and chemo-naive patients with histologically proven malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Gemcitabine 1250 mg m(-2) was administered on day 1 and day 8 and cisplatin 80 mg m(-2) was administered on day 1 in a 3-week cycle with a maximum of six cycles. […] In conclusion this trial excludes with 90% power a response rate of greater than 30% in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma using a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin at the proposed dose and schedule.

The most active commercially available drug for mesothelioma so far appears to be gemcitabine. […] Although gemcitabine has a limited role as a single agent, it is quite active in combination with a platinating agent. […] The impressive 48% response rate reported for the combination of gemcitabine with cisplatin in a single phase II study has made this regimen the new standard of care for off-protocol treatment of this disease, although this trial still requires validation.

Our previous phase II study of cisplatin and gemcitabine in malignant mesothelioma showed a 47.6% (95% CI 26.2-69.0%) response rate with symptom improvement in responding patients. […] Fifty-three patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma received cisplatin 100 mg m(-2) i.v. day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle for a maximum of six cycles. […] Major toxicities were haematological, limiting the mean relative dose intensity of gemcitabine to 75%. […] This schedule of cisplatin and gemcitabine is active in malignant mesothelioma in a multicentre setting. […] Investigation of alternative scheduling is needed to decrease haematological toxicity and increase the relative dose intensity of gemcitabine whilst maintaining response rate and quality of life.

Chemotherapy was comprised of carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve 5 on Day 1 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 8, and 15. […] The delivered dose intensity of gemcitabine was 617 mg/m(2) per week, which was 82% of the planned dose (750 mg/m(2) per week). […] The gemcitabine/carboplatin combination is a valid option in the treatment of MPM due to its acceptable toxicity profile, the good response rate, and the clinical benefit to patients.

The present study addresses the optimization of gemcitabine-cisplatin protocols currently adopted in the clinical management of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), using cell lines derived from different histological subtypes of MPM as an in vitro model. […] Four-hour pre-treatment with gemcitabine followed by 68-h exposure to cisplatin was found to exert synergistic activity in both epithelioid and sarcomatoid MPM subtypes, inducing a strong S-phase arrest that correlated with accumulation of double-strand breaks (DSBs). […] The antiproliferative effects of the gemcitabine/cisplatin combination in mesothelioma cells can be maximized by pre-treatment with gemcitabine, suggesting that this drug increases cisplatin-induced DSBs by inhibiting DNA adduct repair.

No drugs have been shown to improve survival as second-line therapy, yet vinorelbine and gemcitabine are prescribed based on the results of small phase II trials. […] To augment the existing limited data, we examined our institutional experience with vinorelbine and gemcitabine in patients with previously treated MPM. […] We reviewed charts of patients with MPM treated with vinorelbine and/or gemcitabine as second- or third-line therapy between 2003 and 2010. […] Sixty patients were identified: 33 treated with vinorelbine, 15 gemcitabine, and 12 both agents. […] Of 56 patients evaluable radiologically, there was 1 partial response (gemcitabine) giving a response rate of 2% (95% CI: 0-10%). […] Median progression free survival was 1.7 months for vinorelbine and 1.6 months for gemcitabine. […] Response to second- or third-line vinorelbine or gemcitabine is rare.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens on overall survival (OS) in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients receiving first-line pemetrexed-based regimens. […] A total of 73 patients with MPM from Akdeniz University, Acibadem Kayseri Hospital, Kayseri Training and Research Hospital, and Erciyes University were analyzed and evaluated retrospectively as two groups: second-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and no second-line chemotherapy. […] The median OS of patients who received second-line gemcitabine-based chemotherapy was 11.3 (5.1-17.5) months, while it was 9.9 (2.1-17.7) months in the patients who did not receive chemotherapy in the second-line setting (p = 0.056). […] When we evaluated the survival rate at the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 36th month, the OS rate of the 36th month was significantly higher in patients who received gemcitabine-based second-line chemotherapy (p = 0.041). […] When evaluating the OS from diagnosis to death, the median OS values were 20.8 (17.5-24.1) months for first-line pemetrexed-based regimens then second-line gemcitabine alone and 13.1 (9.0-17.1) months supportive care after first-line pemetrexed-based regimens (p = 0.005). […] According to our results, we may consider gemcitabine-based regimens as second-line chemotherapy after treatment with pemetrexed plus platinum in patients with MPM.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a very hypoxic malignancy, and hypoxia has been associated with resistance towards gemcitabine. […] Therefore we investigated the combination of a new LDH-A inhibitor (NHI-1) with gemcitabine in MPM cell lines. […] Under hypoxia (O<sub>2</sub> tension of 1%) the cell growth inhibitory effects of gemcitabine, were reduced, as demonstrated by a 5- to 10-fold increase in IC<sub>50</sub>s. […] Flow cytometry demonstrated that hypoxia caused a G1 arrest, whereas the combination of NHI-1 significantly increased gemcitabine-induced cell death. […] In conclusion, our data show that hypoxia increased MPM resistance to gemcitabine. […] However, cell death induction and modulation of the key transporter in gemcitabine uptake may contribute to the synergistic interaction of gemcitabine with the LDH-A inhibitor NHI-1 and support further studies for the rational development of this combination.

The primary objective of this single-institution phase I clinical trial was to establish the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine added to cisplatin and delivered as heated intraoperative chemotherapy after resection of malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Previously established intracavitary dosing of cisplatin (range 175-225 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) with systemic cytoprotection was used in combination with escalating doses of gemcitabine, following a 3-plus-3 design from 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in 100-mg increments. […] Dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 leukopenia) was observed in two patients who were receiving 1100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of gemcitabine, thus establishing the maximum tolerated dose at 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, in combination with 175 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of cisplatin.
