The authors conducted a Phase II trial in which two drugs (etoposide and 5-fluorouracil) were added to the Cancer and Leukemia Group B cisplatin-mitomycin regimen in an effort to define a more effective chemotherapy. […] Thirty-one patients received cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on Day 1, 5-fluorouracil 600 mg on Days 1-4, folinic acid 100 mg/m2 on Days 1-4, mitomycin C 10 mg/m2 on Day 3, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 i.v. on Days 1-3, with prophylactic hematopoietic growth factors. […] Fourteen patients received cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, and mitomycin C with the protocol unchanged, and oral etoposide 50 mg on Days 1-21 without growth factors (1 cycle every 28 days).

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a combination of cisplatin and irinotecan (CPT-11) in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of CPT-11 and its active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). […] Fifteen previously untreated patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma were treated with cisplatin (60 mg/m2 on Day 1) and CPT-11 (60 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15) administered intravenously and followed by a 1-week rest period. […] The combination of cisplatin and CPT-11 had definite activity against malignant pleural mesothelioma and was well tolerated.

To investigate the therapeutic activity and toxicity of combination chemoimmunotherapy with cisplatin, mitomycin, and interferon (IFN)-alpha2a, by comparing the responses in a group of patients with diffuse malignant pleural mesothelioma (DMPM) to the responses in a control group of DMPM patients given supportive care alone. […] Drugs were administered according to the following schedule: IV cisplatin, 30 mg/m2 qd on days 1 and 2; IV mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 on day 1; and subcutaneous IFN-alpha2a, 4.5 million IU twice weekly.

[…] Ninety-four cycles were given (median, six; mean, 4.5 per patient), with a mean relative dose intensity of cisplatin 96.7% and gemcitabine 82.5%. […] Combined cisplatin and gemcitabine is an active combination in malignant mesothelioma and produces symptomatic benefit in responding patients.

The cisplatin-doxorubicin combination has shown moderate activity in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM; objective response, 25%), and preclinical studies suggest that interferons (IFNs) may have an antiproliferative effect on mesothelioma cell lines with a marked increase in cisplatin cytotoxicity. […] From December 1995 to June 1999, 37 previously untreated patients with MPM were treated with cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) intravenously on Day 1 plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2), recycled every 3-4 weeks and IFN-alpha-2b, 3 x 10((6)) international units subcutaneously 3 times a week for a total of 6 courses or until progression.

Cisplatin (3 microg/mL) and lymphokine-activated killer cells were used to enhance mesothelioma sensitivity to soluble Fas ligand. […] Pretreatment with cisplatin resulted in a reduction of 50% inhibitory concentration from infinity to 4.17 +/- 0.14 ng/mL and 10.23 +/- 1.58 ng/mL, respectively. […] Exposure of these cells to lymphokine-activated killer cells or lymphokine-activated killer cell-conditioned medium followed by a 24-hour treatment with cisplatin resulted in a significant reduction in 50% inhibitory concentration of soluble Fas ligand and pronounced induction of apoptosis.

Recently two antifolate-based combinations with apparently higher efficacy than older regimens have emerged: the pemetrexed/cisplatin regimen and the raltitrexed/oxaliplatin regimen. […] In two phase I trials with pemetrexed combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin responses occurred in five of 11 and nine of 29 patients, respectively. […] Indeed, responses were seen in cisplatin-refractory patients. […] The first study was a multicenter, multinational trial sponsored by Eli Lilly and Company, which randomized more than 430 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma to cisplatin with or without pemetrexed. […] The second trial is being conducted by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and compares cisplatin with or without raltitrexed with planned accrual of 240 patients.

However, a recent single institution study showed an impressive activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin. […] Our aim is to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of a gemcitabine and cisplatin combination in selected and chemo-naive patients with histologically proven malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Gemcitabine 1250 mg m(-2) was administered on day 1 and day 8 and cisplatin 80 mg m(-2) was administered on day 1 in a 3-week cycle with a maximum of six cycles. […] In conclusion this trial excludes with 90% power a response rate of greater than 30% in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma using a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin at the proposed dose and schedule.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal pleural neoplasm that is often resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, and for which little is known regarding carcinogenic pathways. […] Using an antisense targeting approach, we found that attenuation of IAP-1 mRNA levels decreases baseline cell viability and increases the sensitivity of MPM cell lines to cisplatin by nearly 20-fold. […] Our observations strongly suggest that IAP-1 is at least partly responsible for promoting carcinogenesis and mediating resistance to cisplatin in many MPM tumors and that further study of this apoptotic pathway is warranted.

We studied the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cisplatin used during the HITHOC procedure.

[…] Samples of blood and perfusion fluid were collected for doxorubicin and cisplatin measurements. […] The mean AUC(perfusate):AUC(plasma) ratios for doxorubicin and cisplatin (ultrafiltration for plasma) were 99 and 59, respectively. […] During perfusion the concentration in the perfusate declined essentially according to first-order elimination kinetics for both doxorubicin and cisplatin with half-lives of 74 and 138 min, respectively. […] At the end of the perfusion, about 35 and 52% of the dose of doxorubicin and cisplatin, respectively, was recovered in the perfusion fluid.

Intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been used in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma and malignant pleural effusions, but the pharmacokinetics of this form of chemotherapy have not been previously evaluated. […] We performed pharmacokinetic studies on 12 patients who received both intrapleural cisplatin and mitomycin immediately following pleurectomy/decortication for malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] Simultaneous pleural fluid and plasma samples were collected at 15 and 30 minutes, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 hours after administration of the intrapleural chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and mitomycin 8 mg/m2), and after cisplatin (total and free) and mitomycin levels were measured. […] However, the mean peak cisplatin and mitomycin levels, and their mean AUCs, were significantly higher in the pleural fluid than in the plasma. […] There was a three- to fivefold advantage (on a logarithmic scale) for pleural to plasma AUCs for both cisplatin and mitomycin. […] The mean t1/2s for cisplatin and mitomycin were significantly longer in the plasma than in the pleural fluid. […] The pharmacokinetics of intrapleural cisplatin-based chemotherapy are analogous to those of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

An impressive activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin combination in malignant mesothelioma has been shown. […] The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of divided dose of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine in chemo-naïve patients with malignant mesothelioma. […] Cisplatin 35 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) were administered on days 1 and 8 as intravenous infusion in a 3-week cycle, up to maximum 6 cycles. […] Divided dose of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine, at the current dosage and schedule, appears to be an active regimen in chemotherapy-naïve patients with malignant mesothelioma, and well-tolerated.

[…] Local spread and development of IP xenografts was reduced with treatments of ASO alone, and survival of mice afflicted with these xenografts was prolonged after administration of ASO alone and ASO 15999 + cisplatin combination therapy. […] These findings suggest that ASO 15999 sensitizes MPM cell lines to the toxic effects of cisplatin. […] More notably, the combination of Bcl-xL ASO and cisplatin extends survival in an orthotopic tumor xenograft model.

We investigated if a sub-toxic concentration of staphylococcal alpha-toxin could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis and overcome acquired cisplatin-resistance in cultured malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells. […] MPM cells (P31wt) and a cisplatin-resistant sub-line (P31res) was incubated with alpha-toxin and/or cisplatin followed by determination of cell viability, apoptosis, and signaling pathways. […] A low-toxic concentration of alpha-toxin re-sensitized cisplatin P31res cytotoxicity by apoptosis-induced through the mitochondrial pathway without detectable activation of common up-stream apoptosis signaling proteins.

[…] Patients with histologically confirmed MPM, not amenable to curative surgery, received pemetrexed 500 mg/m in combination with either cisplatin 75 mg/m or carboplatin AUC 5, once every 21 days with standard premedication. […] A total of 1704 chemonaïve patients received pemetrexed plus cisplatin (n = 843) or pemetrexed plus carboplatin (n = 861) and were evaluated for safety. […] The efficacy evaluable population consisted of 745 patients in the pemetrexed plus cisplatin group and 752 patients in the pemetrexed plus carboplatin group for whom physician-reported tumor response was available. […] The pemetrexed plus cisplatin group demonstrated a response rate of 26.3% compared with 21.7% for the pemetrexed plus carboplatin group, with similar 1-year survival rates (63.1% versus 64.0%) and median time to progressive disease (7 months versus 6.9 months).

Resistance mechanisms are important limiting factors in the treatment of solid malignancies with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin). […] To gain further understanding of the effects of acquired cisplatin-resistance, we compared a human malignant pleural mesothelioma cell line (p31) to a sub-line (p31res1.2) with acquired cisplatin-resistance. […] The role of Na(+),K(+),2Cl(-)-cotransport (NKCC1) activity in cisplatin-induced morphological changes and acquired cisplatin-resistance was investigated in a time-resolved manner. […] Acquisition of cisplatin-resistance resulted in markedly reduced NKCC1 activity, absence of cisplatin-induced early membrane blebbing, and increased basal caspase-3 activity. […] At equitoxic cisplatin concentrations, P31res1.2 cells had a faster activation of caspase-3 than P31 cells, but the end-stage cytotoxicity and number of cells with DNA fragmentation was similar. […] Bumetanide inhibition of NKCC1 activity in P31 cells repressed cisplatin-induced early-phase membrane blebbing but did not increase P31 cell resistance to cisplatin. […] Together, these results suggest that active NKCC1 was necessary for cisplatin-induced early membrane blebbing of P31 cells, but not for cisplatin-resistance. […] Thus, acquisition of cisplatin-resistance can affect mechanisms that have profound effects on cisplatin-induced morphological changes but are not necessary for the subsequent progression to apoptosis.

Recently, a novel multitargeted antifolate pemetrexed has shown promising activity against malignant pleural mesothelioma, producing response rates of up to 40% when used in combination with cisplatin. […] In a large phase III study, use of a combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was associated with significantly improved survival time and with greater antitumor activity compared with cisplatin alone. […] These clinical benefits of pemetrexed-cisplatin doublet have changed the perception of mesothelioma chemotherapy.

Firstly, pemetrexed was approved in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] The next step was to test pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin, as first-line therapy in advanced NSCLC patients, in a phase III, non-inferiority, randomized trial. […] This trial reported the pemetrexed plus cisplatin regimen to be not inferior, in terms of activity and efficacy, to the control arm but statistically better tolerated. […] To date, pemetrexed is registered, at the dose of 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week schedule, in combination with cisplatin, for first-line therapy and, as single-agent, for second-line treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC.This review shows the latest and indicates the future developments of pemetrexed in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients.

This study aims to investigate the effect of intrapleural polymeric films containing cisplatin on the local recurrence of malignant pleural mesothelioma in a rat tumour model. […] Polymeric films (4.5 cm diameter) for the local delivery of anticancer drug were constructed: hyaluronate, chitosan and the combined dual-layer polymers were loaded with cisplatin at a concentration of 100 mgm(-2). […] Thereafter, the cisplatin-loaded and unloaded films or cisplatin solution were intrapleurally applied, according to randomisation. […] The secondary endpoints were treatment-related toxicity; cisplatin serum concentration evaluated at different time points; and cisplatin concentration in the pleura measured at autopsy. […] Tumour volume was significantly reduced in the hyaluronate cisplatin and hyaluronate-chitosan cisplatin groups in comparison to control groups (p=0.001 and p&lt;0.0001, respectively). […] Animals treated with hyaluronate-chitosan cisplatin had a tumour recurrence significantly lesser than animals treated with cisplatin solution (p=0.003) and hyaluronate cisplatin (p=0.032). […] On postoperative days 1 and 2, cisplatin was detected in the serum at a concentration six- and sevenfold significantly higher in the hyaluronate cisplatin and hyaluronate-chitosan cisplatin groups, in comparison to cisplatin solution, and was maintained over time. […] Cisplatin levels in the pleura were higher in the hyaluronate-chitosan cisplatin group than in all others. […] Hyaluronate-chitosan cisplatin was significantly effective in reducing tumour recurrence compared with cisplatin solution. […] Hyaluronate and hyaluronate-chitosan loaded with cisplatin assured significantly higher and more prolonged plasmatic drug concentrations than cisplatin solution without increasing toxicity.

A major problem with cisplatin treatment is the development of acquired-drug resistance of the tumour cells. […] Cisplatin- and VT-1-induced apoptosis involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and deactivation of MAPKs is associated with cisplatin resistance. […] This study aimed to investigate whether a sub-toxic concentration of VT-1 could enhance cisplatin-induced apoptosis and overcome acquired-cisplatin resistance in cultured cancer cell lines. […] P31 and H1299 cells with corresponding cisplatin-resistant sub-lines (P31res/H1299res) were incubated with VT-1 and/or cisplatin followed by determination of Gb3 expression, cell viability, apoptosis, and signalling pathways. […] Cells from the resistant sub-lines had elevated Gb3 expression compared with the parental cell lines, and cisplatin further increased Gb3 expression, whereas VT-1 reduced the percentage of Gb3-expressing cells. […] Combination of cisplatin and sub-toxic concentrations of VT-1 led to a super-additive increase of cytotoxicity and TUNEL staining, especially in the cisplatin-resistant sub-lines. […] Blockade of Gb3 synthesis by a Gb3 synthesis inhibitor not only led to eradicated TUNEL staining of P31 cells, but also sensitised P31res cells to the induction of apoptosis by cisplatin alone. […] Cisplatin- and VT-1-induced apoptosis involved the MAPK pathways with increased C-Jun N-terminal kinase and MAPK kinase-3 and -6 phosphorylation. […] We show the presence of Gb3 in acquired-cisplatin resistance in P31res and H1299res cells. […] Cisplatin up-regulated Gb3 expression in all cells and thus sensitised the cells to VT-1-induced cytotoxicity. […] A strong super-additive effect of combined cisplatin and a sub-toxic concentration of VT-1 in cisplatin-resistant malignant pleural mesothelioma cells were observed, indicating a new potential clinical-treatment approach.

Since it has been recently suggested that Mcl-1 cooperates with Bcl-x(L) for protection against cell death, we investigated the response of mesothelioma cell lines to the downregulation of Bcl-x(L) (alone or in combination with cisplatin) and the potential interest of its concomitant inhibition with that of Mcl-1. […] Using RNA interference, we showed that Bcl-x(L) depletion sensitized two highly chemoresistant mesothelioma cell lines to cisplatin and that under this treatment, one cell line, MSTO-211H, displayed an apoptotic type of cell death, whereas the other, NCI-H28, evidenced mainly necrotic-type cell death. […] Otherwise, the inhibition of Mcl-1 by cisplatin may contribute to this induction of cell death observed after Bcl-x(L) downregulation. […] In NCI-H28, the addition of a low cisplatin concentration allowed to impede the long-term recovery observed after treatment by the siRNA combination.

Activation of mTOR and impact of mTOR inhibition by temsirolimus was determined in MPM cell lines in vitro (n = 6) and in vivo as xenografts in severe combined immunodeficiency mice (n = 2) either as single agent or in combination with cisplatin. […] Mesothelioma cells with intrinsic or acquired cisplatin resistance exhibited hypersensitivity against temsirolimus. […] Accordingly, cisplatin and temsirolimus exerted synergistic inhibition of the mTOR downstream signals and enhanced growth inhibition and/or apoptosis induction in mesothelioma cell lines. […] Finally, temsirolimus was highly active against MPM xenograft models in severe combined immunodeficiency mice both as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin.

Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)) is a chemotherapeutic drug that is clinically used for the treatment of solid tumours. […] We compared a cisplatin-resistant pleural malignant mesothelioma cell line (P31res1.2) with its parental cell line (P31) regarding the consequences of in vitro acquired cisplatin-resistance on basal and cisplatin-induced (equitoxic and equiapoptotic cisplatin concentrations) caspase-3, -8 and -9 fragmentation and proteolytic activity. […] Acquisition of cisplatin-resistance resulted in basal fragmentation of caspase-8 and -9 without a concomitant increase in proteolytic activity, and there was an increased basal caspase-3/7 activity. […] Similarly, cisplatin-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer cells, H1299res, had increased caspase-3 and -9 content compared with the parental H1299 cells. […] In P31 cells, cisplatin exposure resulted in caspase-9-mediated caspase-3/7 activation, but in P31res1.2 cells the cisplatin-induced caspase-3/7 activation occurred before caspase-8 or -9 activation. […] We therefore concluded that in vitro acquisition of cisplatin-resistance rendered P31res1.2 cells resistant to caspase-8 and caspase-9 fragments and that cisplatin-induced, initiator-caspase independent caspase-3/7 activation was necessary to overcome this resistance.

However, unlike a G(2) checkpoint inhibitor, CBP501 clearly enhances the accumulation of tumor cells at G(2)-M phase that is induced by cisplatin or bleomycin at low doses and short exposure. […] The enhanced accumulation of tumor cells at G(2)-M upon combined treatment with cisplatin and CBP501 results from an increase in intracellular platinum concentrations, which leads to increased binding of platinum to DNA.

[…] An adjusted indirect comparison is used to estimate the relative efficacy of raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin. […] Raltitrexed plus cisplatin and pemetrexed plus cisplatin were not found to be statistically significantly different with respect to overall response, progression free survival or overall survival.

Although cisplatin is used in frontline therapy of this disease treatment remains palliative at best. […] The biochemical pathways activated by cisplatin and the mechanisms of resistance in mesothelioma cells are poorly understood. […] In this study, we examined cisplatin-induced cell death pathways and IAPs in three mesothelioma-derived cell lines. […] Cisplatin induced cell death in mesothelioma cell lines was characterised by biochemical mechanisms classically associated with apoptosis including: mitochondrial depolarisation, phosphatidylserine translocation and caspase activation. […] Knockdown of either XIAP or survivin by RNAi did not affect the sensitivity to cisplatin in any of the cell lines. […] The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD and the more selective caspase 3/7 inhibitor z-DEVD had no effect upon the sensitivity of any of the cell lines to cisplatin indicating that caspase-independent pathways predominate.

As a first line chemotherapy the most often used was cisplatin in combination with pemetrexed. […] Because of the low number of patients and different treatment approaches data from a particular patient setting are inconclusive, but from the literature there is evidence that patients with malignant intraperitoneal mesothelioma should undergo optimal cytoreduction and receive a combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed as a first line chemotherapy for intravenous or cisplatin in different chemotherapy regimens using the intraperitoneal administration route, if accessible, with even higher overall survival rates.

Cisplatin plus pemetrexed is a standard front-line chemotherapeutic regimen for inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). […] However, no clinical trials have compared the efficacy of cisplatin plus pemetrexed and cisplatin plus gemcitabine, which may be comparable based on previous phase II study results. […] This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of cisplatin plus pemetrexed and comparing it with that of cisplatin plus gemcitabine in Japanese MPM patients. […] From July 2002 to December 2011, 13 and 17 consecutive patients with inoperable MPM were treated with cisplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin plus pemetrexed, respectively, at the Shizuoka Cancer Center. […] The response rates were 15% and 35% in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin plus pemetrexed groups, respectively (P=0.4069), while disease control rates were 77%, and 82%, respectively (P=0.9999). […] Progression-free survival was significantly higher with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (median, 215.5 days) than with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (median, 142.5 days) (P=0.0146; hazard ratio [HR], 0.3552). […] Overall survival showed a tendency towards being superior with cisplatin plus pemetrexed (median, 597.5 days) compared with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (median, 306.5 days) (P=0.1725, HR, 0.5516). […] Hematological toxicities, especially thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, tended to be more frequent and severe in the cisplatin plus gemcitabine group.

The effects of cisplatin on the lung parenchyma during hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion have not been analysed in detail. […] The objective of this study was to evaluate both the concentration and depth of the penetration of cisplatin in human lung tissue after hyperthermic exposure under ex vivo conditions. […] Twelve patients underwent pulmonary wedge resections after elective thoracic lobectomies were performed (resected lobe), and the lung tissue (approximately 1-2 cm(3)) was incubated (in vitro) with cisplatin (0.05 mg/ml; 60 min, 42°C). […] Subsequent tissue beds (depth, 0.5 mm; median weight, 70-92 mg) were prepared from the outside to the middle, and the amount of cisplatin per tissue weight was analysed using atomic absorption spectrometry. […] Afterwards, the penetration of cisplatin depth was calculated and related to the different concentrations per tissue. […] Cisplatin penetrated into the human lung tissue after ex vivo hyperthermic exposure. […] The median amount of platinum [nmol cisplatin/g lung tissue] decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) depending on the penetration depth: 32 nmol/g (1 mm), 20 nmol/g (2 mm) and 6.8 nmol/g (4 mm). […] The calculated median concentrations of cisplatin (µg/ml) were 2.4 µg/ml (1 mm), 1.4 µg/ml (2 mm) and 0.5 µg/ml (4 mm), respectively. […] Under ex vivo hyperthermic conditions, cisplatin diffused into human lung tissue. […] The median penetration depth of the cisplatin was approximately 3-4 mm. […] The penetration of cisplatin into lung tissue may affect the local therapy of residual tumour cells on the lung surface using hyperthermic intrathoracic chemotherapy perfusion in patients with malignant pleural tumours.

[…] Furthermore, a combination of dasatinib and cisplatin induced apoptosis more significantly than either alone in suspension cultures. […] These results suggest that spheroid formation induces resistance to anoikis and to cisplatin through SFK activation and that dasatinib facilitates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human mesothelioma cells.

[…] The primary objective was the plasmatic and pleural concentration of cisplatin in the treatment groups. […] Cisplatin blood levels obtained from polymeric films application were low during the first 24 hours after the application; then, the cisplatin blood level increased gradually and progressively until it reached significantly higher plasmatic concentrations after 120 hours compared to intrapleural cisplatin solution (P=0.004) and intravenous administration (P=0.001), respectively. […] Considering cisplatin concentration at 168 hours after the application, animals treated with polymeric films had higher plasmatic values than animals treated with intrapleural cisplatin solution and intravenous cisplatin (P=0.001). […] Despite the high cisplatin plasmatic concentrations, treatment related-toxicity towards kidneys and liver was comparatively lower compared to the intravenous and intrapleural cisplatin administration and closer to the control levels.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is moderately active in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) due to intrinsic drug resistance and to low immunogenicity of MPM cells. […] We investigated if LIP levels can predict the clinical response to cisplatin and survival of MPM patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy. […] We studied the LIP-dependent mechanisms determining cisplatin-resistance and we identified pharmacological approaches targeting LIP, able to restore cisplatin sensitiveness, in patient-derived MPM cells and animal models. […] We found that LIP was degraded by constitutive ubiquitination in primary MPM cells derived from patients poorly responsive to cisplatin. […] LIP ubiquitination was directly correlated with cisplatin chemosensitivity and was associated with patients’ survival after chemotherapy. […] Overexpression of LIP restored cisplatin’s pro-apoptotic effect by activating CHOP/TRB3/caspase 3 axis and up-regulating calreticulin, that triggered MPM cell phagocytosis by dendritic cells and expanded autologous anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup>CD107<sup>+</sup>T-cytotoxic lymphocytes. […] The triple combination of carfilzomib, chloroquine and cisplatin increased ER stress-triggered apoptosis and immunogenic cell death in patients’ samples, and reduced tumor growth in cisplatin-resistant MPM preclinical models. […] The loss of LIP mediates cisplatin resistance, rendering LIP a possible predictor of cisplatin response in MPM patients.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive malignant tumor in which cisplatin therapy is commonly used, although its effectiveness is limited. […] Our objective in this study was to investigate the hypothesis that ADP also potentiates the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin. […] Results show that in ZL55 cells ADP enhanced (a) the cytotoxicity of cisplatin by 12-fold, (b) the restraint of cell clonogenic potential cisplatin-mediated, and (c) the number of apoptotic cells. […] Cisplatin, but not ADP, caused caspases activation; nevertheless, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 was not only cleaved in cisplatin-treated cells but also in cells treated with ADP alone. […] Furthermore, ADP, but not cisplatin, decreased mTOR and 6SK phosphorylations. […] Both ADP and cisplatin increased p53 protein, but ADP was also able to enhance p53 messenger RNA. […] P53 silencing resulted in a very large decrement of cell death induced by ADP or by cisplatin and reverted ADP effects on mTOR/S6K phosphorylation, suggesting that activated p53 may act as a negative regulator of mTOR. […] Consistently, the inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin also sensitized cells to cisplatin, and the effects of cisplatin plus rapamycin were identical to those obtained with cisplatin plus ADP. […] These findings suggest that the combination of ADP and cisplatin may be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of cisplatin-resistant MPM.

[…] This prospective observational study involved 45 chemotherapy-naïve patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy with ≥60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cisplatin for histologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or malignant pleural mesothelioma. […] This is the first report demonstrating that prechemotherapy urinary A-megalin levels are correlated with the development of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. […] This finding has clinical implications for the identification of patients at risk for cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and the development of possible prophylactic therapies.

We investigated TLR3 expression and sensitivity of human mesothelioma cell lines to the synthetic dsRNA Poly(I:C), alone or in combination with cisplatin, the gold standard chemotherapy in mesothelioma. […] The combined cisplatin/Poly(I:C) treatment enhanced apoptosis of 3/4 Poly(I:C)-sensitive cell lines and overcame resistance to Poly(I:C) or cisplatin alone in 2/4 cell lines. […] Efficacy of the combined treatment relied on cisplatin-induced downregulation of c-FLIP, the main regulator of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, leading to an enhanced caspase-8-mediated pathway. […] Patient-derived cells were sensitive to Poly(I:C) alone while the combined cisplatin/Poly(I:C) treatment induced dramatic cell death. […] Our findings demonstrate that TLR3 targeting in combination with cisplatin presents an innovative therapeutic strategy in mesothelioma.

For this exploratory study, we screened MPM cell lines (NCI-H2452, NCI-H2052, and MSTO-211H) differing in response to cisplatin and benign control fibroblasts (MRC-5) for overall phosphorylation patterns as well as kinase activity with respect to cellular response to cisplatin-based therapeutics. […] Cisplatin alters cellular phosphorylation patterns affecting cell cycle, migration, adhesion, signal transduction, immune modulation, and apoptosis. […] In cisplatin-responsive cell lines, phosphorylation of AKT1 and GSK3B was decreased but could not be influenced in cisplatin-resistant NCI-H2452 cells. […] Cisplatin-responsive cell lines showed increased phosphorylation levels of JNK1/2/3 but decreased phosphorylation in cisplatin-resistant NCI-H2452 cells. […] Cisplatin influences phosphorylation patterns with distinct features in cisplatin-resistant cells. […] Based on our results, the induction of p38 or JNK1/3, or inhibition of AKT1 by, for example, BIA-6, might offer a positive synergistic effect by induction of an apoptotic response to cisplatin-based treatment, thus potentially enhancing the clinical outcome of MPM patients.

Nevertheless, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide and perhaps other agents as well have modest activity. […] In the Cancer and Leukemia Group B study, the response rate in patients with measurable disease was 24% for cisplatin and either mitomycin C and doxorubicin, the highest response rates reported for a cooperative group study.

This report describes the results of a Phase III trial comparing maximum debulking surgery and postoperative cisplatin, interferon alpha-2b, and tamoxifen (CIT) immunochemotherapy with and without intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) to determine (1) whether such a multimodal approach can be performed with minimum morbidity and mortality in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), and (2) whether first-generation (i.e., 630-nm laser light, Photofrin II) intrapleural PDT impacts on local recurrence of survival.

From June 1984 to October 1995, forty seven consecutive patients (pts) with a confirmed diagnosis of diffuse malignant mesothelioma (MM) of the pleura (41) and peritoneum (6), were treated with cisplatin (CDDP) (24 pts) (Group A), or Doxorubicin (ADM) (14) based chemotherapy (Group B), or a combination of CDDP and ADM (9 pts) (Group C).

The antitumor effectiveness of cisplatin, paclitaxel, and suramin as single agents and in combination was evaluated in vivo against four lines of human pleural malignant mesothelioma xenografts in athymic nude mice, including one epithelial type and three fibrosarcomatous. […] After growth of tumors occurred by day 54 or 55, mice were randomized in groups of four each to receive either cisplatin 4 mg/kg intraperitoneally weekly x5, or paclitaxel (Taxol) 12.5 mg/kg subcutaneously daily 5 days/week for 3 consecutive weeks, or suramin 60 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily x4,versus controls treated with normal saline. […] Cisplatin was very effective against one line and also to a lesser degree against another line. […] Paclitaxel showed antitumor effects similar to cisplatin, being very effective in one line, and also showed good activity in another line. […] Following the results obtained with these single agents, it was decided to evaluate the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel, which resulted in more pronounced antitumor effect in all four cell lines. […] These results indicate that the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel is superior to each agent alone in this model, and that it deserves to be evaluated in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

The patient showed a remarkable response to combined chemotherapy with an accompanying intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin and etoposide and an intravenous injection of caffeine. […] The patient was administered a combination drug of uracil and tegafur (UFT) in addition to intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin as an outpatient. […] Another regimen of chemotherapy with cisplatin and CPT-11 was performed.

This Phase II study (CALGB 9031) was conducted to determine the effectiveness of and toxicities that would result from adding cisplatin to DHAC administered to the same patient population. […] Thirty-six patients were treated with concurrent DHAC at 1500 mg/m2/day for 5 days by continuous infusion and cisplatin 15 mg/m2 daily for 5 days. […] Cisplatin was to be increased to 20 mg/m2 daily in subsequent cycles if toxicity was minimal. […] The addition of cisplatin to DHAC did not increase the response rate over that observed with DHAC alone in patients with mesothelioma; however, it did increase toxicity, especially leukopenia.

Recently, i.p. cisplatin has been shown to be superior to i.v. cisplatin in improving the survival of patients with ovarian carcinoma and minimal residual disease. […] We conclude that: (a) the MTD of intrapleural L-NDDP is 50% higher than the MTD after i.v. administration; (b) intrapleural L-NDDP causes mild nausea and vomiting and no myelosuppression at the MTD; and (c) the absorption of L-NDDP into the systemic circulation is much slower than that of the parent compound cisplatin.
