We performed 36 partial diathermic abrasions on pleura combined with talc insufflation, and in 39 cases only talc poudrage.

Pleurodesis with talc is an accepted method for the treatment of symptomatic pleural effusions secondary to mesotheliomas. […] Patients with mesothelioma who have talc-induced pleurodesis have a lower morbidity than do those who do not have pleurodesis. […] The mechanisms whereby talc mediated these effects were considered to be secondary to a decrease or absence of a pleural effusion. […] The possibility that talc may directly affect malignant cells was not considered. […] The present study was designed to evaluate if talc directly effects cell death of malignant mesothelioma cells (MMC) or normal pleural mesothelial cells (PMC). […] Three confluent MMC and PMC were exposed to talc for 24, 48, and 72 h. […] In parallel experiments, glass beads similar in size to talc were included as control. […] Our results demonstrated that talc at a therapeutically achievable concentration (6 microg/cm(2)) induces significant apoptosis in MMC. […] Talc-induced maximum apoptosis in MMC (39.50 +/- 2.55%, 31.87 +/- 4.69%, and 15.10 +/- 3.93% in CRL-2081, CRL-5820, and CRL-5915, respectively) at 48 h, which was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater than that in control cells. […] Electrophoresis of DNA isolated from talc-exposed MMC demonstrated the typical ladder pattern of internucleosomal DNA cleavage. […] Talc did not induce apoptosis in PMC, and glass beads did not cause significant apoptosis in either MMC or PMC. […] The present study has demonstrated that talc induces apoptosis in MMC without affecting normal mesothelial cells of the pleura.

Thoracoscopy has the additional advantage of allowing pleurodesis with talc poudrage if clear tumour lesions are found in the pleura. […] In cases of malignant effusion which are not sensitive to chemotherapy, pleurodesis is the treatment of choice for palliation of symptoms, and talc is the most effective agent. […] It can be used either in suspension (“slurry”) or in dry aerosolized form (“talc poudrage”), but it seems that this last technique achieves the best effects.

Over the last 15 years we have managed patients with malignant pleural effusion, using a single procedure with thoracoscopy and talc pleurodesis or shunt as appropriate.

The main therapeutic option for palliative purposes in these cases is chemical pleurodesis with talc.

[…] We treated 14 of these patients with talc poudrage and 2 patients with talc slurry. […] The talc was applied under video-assisted thorascopic management in 15 patients, while in 1 patient the talc was injected via the thoracic drainage tube.

[…] Talc pleurodesis induces a marked pseudosarcomatous fibroblastic proliferation which may impart a biphasic pattern to the neoplasm. […] The talc is polarizable and deposited in linear fashion within the tumour. […] Talc could be identified by transmission electron microscopic mineral analysis in 5/15 (33%) cases examined.

Since 1982, we have performed thoracoscopic talc poudrage (TTP) as a primary therapy in mesothelioma patients presenting with pleural effusion. […] As the survival data for our patients surpassed that of many published series, the patient data was analyzed to determine whether talc poudrage can be considered as a contemporary palliative option. […] Prospective randomized studies are needed to compare quality of life and survival after talc poudrage and other therapies.

Talc remains the most effective sclerosing agent for pleurodesis. […] The present study evaluated the angiogenic balance in the pleural space in patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) following talc insufflation. […] Patient pleural fluid samples were collected both before and after talc insufflation. […] The biological effects of pleural fluids and conditioned media from talc-activated PMC on endothelial cells were evaluated by performing proliferation, invasion, tube formation and apoptosis assays. […] Pleural fluids from patients with MPE who received thoracoscopic talc insufflation contained significantly higher levels of endostatin (median 16.75 ng.mL(-1)) compared with pre-talc instillation (1.06 ng.mL(-1)). […] Talc-activated PMC released significantly greater amounts of endostatin (mean+/-SEM 1052.39+/-38.66 pg.mL(-1)) when compared with a MMC line (134.73+/-8.72 pg.mL(-1)). […] In conclusion, talc alters the angiogenic balance in the pleural space from a biologically active and angiogenic environment to an angiostatic milieu. […] Functional improvement following talc poudrage in patients with malignant pleural effusions may, in part, reflect these alterations in the pleural space.

Talc pleurodesis is a well-established procedure performed to obliterate the pleural space to prevent recurrent pleural effusion and/or recurrent pneumothorax. […] The reported complications of talc pleurodesis are hypoxemia, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, chest pain, and fever. […] Herein, we present a case of a 43-year-old female patient who developed an intense mesothelioid reaction which occurred 7 years following talc pleurodesis. […] This case represents a unique mesothelioid reaction which became manifested several years after recurrent talc pleurodesis. […] We conclude that Talc pleurodesis played a causative role in this patient developing an intense mesothelioid reaction.

Talc pleurodesis has been reported to increase fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the high attenuation areas of pleural thickening, making it difficult to distinguish between benign granulomatous inflammatory processes and malignancies, which may therefore interfere with the post-chemotherapy disease evaluation on FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). […] We present two cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with talc pleurodesis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before pleurectomy/decortication in which post-NAC FDG-PET/CT showed intense FDG uptakes in the high attenuation areas of pleural thickening with false positive result, whereas post-NAC <sup>11</sup>C-choline PET/CT showed mild choline uptake of pleural talc deposit, which did not interfere with the post-chemotherapy disease evaluation. […] Thus we suggest choline-PET/CT may show little choline uptake to granulomatous inflammation and evaluate treatment response in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with talc pleurodesis and NAC.
